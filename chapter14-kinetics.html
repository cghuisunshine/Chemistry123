  <h1>Chapter 14: Chemical Kinetics</h1>

  <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
  <p>By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Define reaction rate and relate it to the change in reactant or product concentration over time.</li>
    <li>Write and interpret rate laws and reaction orders using experimental rate data.</li>
    <li>Use integrated rate laws and half‑life expressions for zero‑, first‑, and second‑order reactions (conceptually, with emphasis on first order).</li>
    <li>Apply collision theory and the Arrhenius equation to relate rate constants to activation energy and temperature.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Key Vocabulary</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Reaction rate</strong>: change in concentration per unit time.</li>
    <li><strong>Rate law</strong>: relationship between rate and reactant concentrations, often determined empirically.</li>
    <li><strong>Order of reaction</strong>: exponent of a concentration term in the rate law (overall order is sum of exponents).</li>
    <li><strong>Half‑life (t<sub>1/2</sub>)</strong>: time required for concentration to fall to half its initial value.</li>
    <li><strong>Activation energy (E<sub>a</sub>)</strong>: energy barrier that must be overcome for reaction to occur.</li>
    <li><strong>Arrhenius equation</strong>: <code>k = A e^{-E_a/(RT)}</code>.</li>
    <li><strong>Catalyst</strong>: substance that speeds up a reaction without being consumed; lowers effective E<sub>a</sub>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>1. Reaction Rates</h2>
  <p>For a simple reaction A → products, the rate can be expressed as:</p>
  <p><code>\text{rate} = −Δ[A]/Δt</code></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Minus sign ensures the rate is positive because [A] decreases.</li>
    <li>For more complex reactions, stoichiometric factors relate rates of consumption and formation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Rate Laws and Reaction Orders</h2>
  <p>General form for A → products:</p>
  <p><code>\text{rate} = k[A]^n</code></p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>k</em> is the rate constant (depends on temperature, not on concentrations).</li>
    <li><em>n</em> is the order in A; it must be determined from experimental data, not from the balanced equation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Worked Example 1 – Finding Order from Initial Rates</h3>
  <p>Suppose doubling [A] doubles the rate, while [B] is held constant. Then the reaction is first order in A. If doubling [A] quadruples the rate, it is second order in A.</p>

  <h2>3. Integrated Rate Laws and Half‑Life</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Zero‑order: <code>[A]_t = [A]_0 − kt</code>.</li>
    <li>First‑order: <code>\ln([A]_t/[A]_0) = −kt</code>; half‑life <code>t_{1/2} = 0.693/k</code>.</li>
    <li>Second‑order: <code>1/[A]_t = 1/[A]_0 + kt</code>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Worked Example 2 – First‑Order Half‑Life</h3>
  <p>A first‑order reaction has k = 0.025 s<sup>−1</sup>. What is its half‑life?</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Use <code>t_{1/2} = 0.693/k</code>.</li>
    <li><code>t_{1/2} = 0.693 / 0.025 ≈ 27.7\,\text{s}</code>.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>4. Collision Theory and Arrhenius Equation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Reactions occur when molecules collide with enough energy (≥ E<sub>a</sub>) and proper orientation.</li>
    <li>Arrhenius equation: <code>k = A e^{-E_a/(RT)}</code>.</li>
    <li>Taking natural logs: <code>\ln k = \ln A − E_a/(RT)</code> → plot ln k vs 1/T gives a straight line with slope −E<sub>a</sub>/R.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Effect of Temperature</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Increasing temperature increases the fraction of molecules with energy ≥ E<sub>a</sub>, so k and rate increase.</li>
    <li>A common rule of thumb: rates roughly double for every 10 °C increase (not exact, just a quick estimate).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Catalysis (Qualitative)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Catalysts provide an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy.</li>
    <li>They are not consumed overall; they appear in elementary steps but are regenerated.</li>
    <li>Biological catalysts (enzymes) are highly specific and operate under mild conditions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Practice Problems (Self-Check)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>For A → products, rate data show that doubling [A] doubles the rate while tripling [A] triples the rate. What is the order in A and the general form of the rate law?</li>
    <li>A first‑order reaction has k = 0.0100 min<sup>−1</sup>. (a) What is its half‑life? (b) How much time is needed for 75% of A to react?</li>
    <li>Sketch ln[A] vs t and 1/[A] vs t for first‑ and second‑order reactions and indicate which should be linear.</li>
    <li>The rate constant doubles when temperature is increased from 300 K to 310 K. What does this suggest qualitatively about the activation energy barrier?</li>
    <li>Describe how a catalyst can lower E<sub>a</sub> and give one everyday example of catalysis (for example, catalytic converters, enzymes in digestion).</li>
