  <h1>Chapter 4: Reactions in Aqueous Solution</h1>
  <section class="section" id="section-4-1">
    <h2>4.1 General Properties of Aqueous Solutions</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Aqueous solutions consist of solutes dispersed and solvated by polar water molecules; ionic solids dissociate into ions while most molecular solutes remain neutral.</li>
      <li>Electrolytes carry charge because they yield ions in water: strong electrolytes are essentially fully ionic, weak electrolytes keep most molecules intact, and nonelectrolytes stay molecular.</li>
      <li>Solvation stabilizes ions and lets them diffuse, which explains why water conducts electricity when ionic compounds dissolve.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Weak electrolyte ionization</strong> <code>CH3COOH(aq) ⇌ CH3COO- (aq) + H+ (aq)</code>
      <p>The half-arrows show that acetic acid molecules are mostly un-ionized but a small fraction dissociates into acetate and hydrogen ions; the forward and reverse processes reach equilibrium so the ion concentrations stay low.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Strong electrolyte ionization</strong> <code>HCl(aq) → H+ (aq) + Cl- (aq)</code>
      <p>Strong acids like hydrochloric acid dissociate nearly completely, so their aqueous solutions contain ions that freely conduct electricity. The one-way arrow indicates the ionized form is overwhelmingly favored.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">A 0.10 M NaCl solution donates 0.10 M Na+ and 0.10 M Cl- ions to the water, so the total ionic concentration is 0.20 M, explaining why its conductivity is much higher than that of 0.10 M sucrose, which remains molecular.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="section" id="section-4-2">
    <h2>4.2 Precipitation Reactions</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>When two soluble electrolytes mix, oppositely charged ions can form an insoluble solid (precipitate) whose formation is predicted using solubility rules.</li>
      <li>Metathesis (exchange) reactions follow AX + BY → AY + BX and are the basis for precipitation and many acid-base reactions.</li>
      <li>Molecular, complete ionic, and net ionic equations clarify which species change during the reaction; spectator ions are removed in the net ionic form.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Lead iodide precipitation</strong> <code>Pb(NO3)2(aq) + 2 KI(aq) → PbI2(s) + 2 KNO3(aq)</code>
      <p>Lead(II) and iodide ions pair to give the insoluble PbI2 solid; potassium and nitrate stay dissolved. Because PbI2 is a strong precipitate, the reaction is driven by the ion pairing that overcomes solvation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Net ionic equation</strong> <code>Pb2+ (aq) + 2 I- (aq) → PbI2(s)</code>
      <p>The net ionic equation retains only the ions that participate in the formation of PbI2, showing how the charges (2+ and two 1-) balance to zero in the neutral solid.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">Mixing Mg(NO3)2 and NaOH yields Mg(OH)2 precipitate because hydroxide ions are generally insoluble except with the alkali metals; sodium nitrate remains aqueous so the net ionic equation is Mg2+ + 2 OH- → Mg(OH)2(s).</p>
  </section>
  <section class="section" id="section-4-3">
    <h2>4.3 Acids, Bases, and Neutralization Reactions</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Acids donate protons (H+) and increase H+ concentration; bases accept protons or generate OH- ions, and strong/weak labels follow electrolyte strength.</li>
      <li>Neutralization between a strong acid and a strong base yields water and a salt and is a special kind of metathesis reaction.</li>
      <li>Some acid-base reactions produce gases (H2S, CO2) through intermediate species like carbonic acid.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Diprotic acid ionization</strong> <code>H2SO4(aq) → H+(aq) + HSO4-(aq), HSO4-(aq) ⇌ H+(aq) + SO42-(aq)</code>
      <p>Sulfuric acid supplies two protons. The first dissociation is complete (strong acid), while the second is only partial so the second equilibrium arrow shows weak electrolyte behavior.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Neutralization</strong> <code>H+(aq) + OH-(aq) → H2O(l)</code>
      <p>Any strong acid-base neutralization reduces H+ and OH- to water; the net ionic equation eliminates spectator ions and highlights proton transfer.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Gas-forming neutralization</strong> <code>H+(aq) + HCO3-(aq) → H2O(l) + CO2(g)</code>
      <p>Carbonate and bicarbonate react with acids to form carbonic acid, which quickly decomposes to water and gaseous CO2, producing fizz in antacid tablets.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">Adding Ba(OH)2 to acetic acid produces Ba(CH3COO)2 and water: 2 CH3COOH + Ba(OH)2 → 2 H2O + Ba(CH3COO)2. Breaking soluble species into ions leaves the net ionic equation CH3COOH + OH- → H2O + CH3COO-.</p>

    <h2>4.4 Oxidation–Reduction Reactions</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Redox reactions transfer electrons: oxidation increases the oxidation state (loss of electrons), reduction decreases it (gain of electrons).</li>
      <li>Oxidation numbers assign hypothetical charges according to established rules, letting us track which atoms change charge during a reaction.</li>
      <li>Activity series rank metals by ease of oxidation, predicting whether a metal will reduce another ion or react with acids.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Oxidation by oxygen</strong> <code>2 Ca(s) + O2(g) → 2 CaO(s)</code>
      <p>Calcium atoms go from 0 to +2 (oxidation), while O2 is reduced to O2- ions; the electron transfer is the essential redox process in formation of CaO.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Metal + acid</strong> <code>Mg(s) + 2 HCl(aq) → MgCl2(aq) + H2(g)</code>
      <p>Magnesium oxidizes to Mg2+, and H+ reduces to H2 gas; Cl- ions are spectators. The net ionic form is Mg + 2 H+ → Mg2+ + H2.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">Iron metal reacts with nickel(II) salts because Fe is higher in the activity series than Ni. The net ionic equation Fe + Ni2+ → Fe2+ + Ni shows iron oxidized while nickel ions become metal.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="section" id="section-4-5">
    <h2>4.5 Concentrations of Solutions</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Molarity (M) expresses concentration as moles of solute per liter of solution and allows conversion between moles, mass, and volume.</li>
      <li>Ionic compounds contribute multiple ions; the molar concentration of each ion equals the molarity of the dissolved compound multiplied by the stoichiometric coefficient.</li>
      <li>Dilution conserves solute moles (M_i V_i = M_f V_f), so adding solvent lowers molarity while maintaining the solute quantity.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Molarity</strong> <code>M = moles solute / liters solution</code>
      <p>Dividing the amount of solute by the total solution volume (in liters) gives the concentration. For example, dissolving 0.165 mol Na2SO4 in 0.125 L yields 1.32 M.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Dilution</strong> <code>Mconc Vconc = Mdil Vdil</code>
      <p>The moles of solute before and after dilution are equal, so molarity times volume stays constant. This lets you calculate the volume of stock solution needed to reach a target concentration.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">To make 250 mL of 0.100 M CuSO4 from a 1.00 M stock, you need Vconc = (0.100×250 mL)/1.00 = 25.0 mL; diluting this volume to 250 mL preserves the total moles of CuSO4.</p>

    <h2>4.6 Solution Stoichiometry and Chemical Analysis</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Stoichiometric calculations involving solutions combine molarity and molar volume to convert between moles of solutes.</li>
      <li>Titrations compare a solution of unknown concentration with a standard solution until a stoichiometric equivalence point is reached, often indicated by an acid-base indicator.</li>
      <li>Precipitation or gas-forming titrations use balanced equations to relate reagent volumes to analyte quantities.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Stoichiometric chain for solutions</strong> <code>V · M → mol → mol₂ → V₂ · M₂</code>
      <p>You convert volume and molarity of a known solution to moles, use mole ratios to get moles of the unknown, and then convert back to volume or mass using the final solute’s molarity or molar mass.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Standard titration result</strong> <code>M₁V₁/n₁ = M₂V₂/n₂</code>
      <p>When two solutions react according to stoichiometric coefficients n₁ and n₂, the numbers of moles at the equivalence point satisfy this ratio; use it to find the unkown molarity or volume.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">Titrating 20.0 mL of unknown NaOH with 45.7 mL of 0.500 M H2SO4 (where 1 mol H2SO4 reacts with 2 mol NaOH) gives mol NaOH = (0.0457×0.500×2) = 0.0457 mol; dividing by 0.0200 L yields [NaOH] = 2.28 M.</p>
