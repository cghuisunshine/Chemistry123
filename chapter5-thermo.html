    <h2>5.1 The Nature of Chemical Energy</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Chemical energy is stored as electrostatic potential energy between charged particles and is released or absorbed when bonds break or form.</li>
      <li>Heat and work are the two observable ways chemical systems exchange energy with the surroundings.</li>
      <li>Processes that move atoms apart or together alter the electrostatic potential energy, which is why bonded structures are sources of stored energy.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Mechanical work</strong> <code>w = F * d</code>
      <p>Work equals the force <em>F</em> applied over a displacement <em>d</em>. If you push a cart with 50 N for 5 m, you transfer 250 J of energy into the cart; the system gains energy when work is done on it (positive <code>w</code>).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Electrostatic potential energy</strong> <code>E<sub>el</sub> = k * Q<sub>1</sub> * Q<sub>2</sub> / d</code>
      <p>The energy between two charges depends on their magnitudes <em>Q<sub>1</sub></em>, <em>Q<sub>2</sub></em>, their separation <em>d</em>, and Coulomb’s constant <em>k</em> ≈ 8.99 × 10⁹ J·m/C². Like charges have positive <code>E<sub>el</sub></code>, opposite charges negative, so bonding lowers energy and releases heat.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">Bringing Na⁺ and Cl⁻ together drops their electrostatic potential energy, which is released as heat when NaCl forms. This stored chemical potential explains why combustion and other bond-making reactions can power engines and metabolism.</p>

  <section class="section" id="section-5-2">
    <h2>5.2 The First Law of Thermodynamics</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The first law states that the change in a system’s internal energy equals the heat added plus the work done on the system: energy is conserved.</li>
      <li>Systems can exchange energy with the surroundings as heat (q) or mechanical work (w), while matter exchange depends on whether the system is open, closed, or isolated.</li>
      <li>Energy changes are measured for the system, but every gain for the system equals a loss for the surroundings and vice versa.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>First law</strong> <code>ΔE = q + w</code>
      <p>The internal energy change <code>ΔE</code> equals the sum of heat transferred <code>q</code> and work <code>w</code>. Both <code>q</code> and <code>w</code> are positive when energy flows into the system; negative if energy flows out. For example, if a reaction loses 1150 J of heat and the surroundings do 480 J of work on it, then ΔE = -1150 + 480 = -670 J.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Work for constant pressure</strong> <code>w = -P ΔV</code></div>
    <p>When gases expand against a constant external pressure <em>P</em>, the system performs work on the surroundings. Positive ΔV gives negative work, reducing the system’s energy.</p>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">In a closed piston, burning H₂ and O₂ pushes the piston upward (ΔV positive). The gases do work on the environment, giving <code>w = -PΔV</code>, so the internal energy change combines the negative work and the heat released by the exothermic reaction.</p>

    <h2>5.3 Enthalpy</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Enthalpy H = E + PV is a state function that keeps track of internal energy plus the PV work term, making it especially useful at constant pressure.</li>
      <li>At atmospheric pressure, ∆H equals the heat exchanged (<code>q<sub>P</sub></code>), simplifying calorimetry for many chemical reactions.</li>
      <li>In endothermic processes ∆H is positive (heat absorbed); in exothermic processes ∆H is negative (heat released).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Enthalpy definition</strong> <code>H = E + PV</code>
      <p>Enthalpy sums a system’s internal energy <code>E</code> and the product of its pressure and volume. At constant pressure, changes in <code>H</code> reflect heat flow because ΔH = ΔE + PΔV.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>ΔH at constant pressure</strong> <code>ΔH = q<sub>P</sub></code>
      <p>When pressure is fixed, the enthalpy change equals the heat transferred. Measuring the temperature change in a calorimeter lets us compute ΔH directly.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">Combustion of methane at constant atmospheric pressure releases heat so ΔH is negative and equals the heat flowing out of the system; this heat warms the surroundings and gives a clear enthalpy diagram with reactants above the products.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="section" id="section-5-4">
    <h2>5.4 Enthalpies of Reaction</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The enthalpy change of a reaction depends on the reactants, products, and their physical states, and is often reported per mole of a specified substance.</li>
      <li>Balanced chemical equations can include an associated ΔH value to report whether the reaction is exothermic or endothermic</li>
      <li>Enthalpy diagrams visualize the relative energies of reactants and products, showing whether ΔH is positive or negative.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Enthalpy of reaction</strong> <code>ΔH = H<sub>products</sub> - H<sub>reactants</sub></code>
      <p>This difference gives the heat released or absorbed; the sign tells you whether the system loses energy (negative ΔH, exothermic) or gains energy (positive ΔH, endothermic).</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">If the enthalpy of the products is lower than that of the reactants, ΔH is negative and heat exits the system. The combustion of C + O₂ → CO₂ has ΔH° = -393.5 kJ/mol, so energy flows to the surroundings.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="section" id="section-5-5">
    <h2>5.5 Calorimetry</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Calorimetry tracks the temperature change of a known mass to quantify heat flow because the heat absorbed/released equals the mass × specific heat × temperature change.</li>
      <li>Bomb calorimeters hold constant volume, so the heat measured relates to ΔE; coffee-cup calorimeters operate at constant pressure and yield ΔH.</li>
      <li>Heat absorbed by the calorimeter and solution are accounted for to determine reaction enthalpies.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Heat</strong> <code>q = C<sub>s</sub> * m * ΔT</code>
      <p>Multiply the specific heat <em>C<sub>s</sub></em>, mass <em>m</em>, and temperature change <em>ΔT</em> to calculate heat exchanged. In differential calorimetry, add together the heats for each component to find the reaction heat.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">Heating 25.0 g of water (C<sub>s</sub> = 4.18 J/g·K) from 21.0 °C to 27.5 °C absorbs q = 4.18 × 25.0 × 6.5 ≈ 680 J, so a reaction that cools the water by 6.5 °C releases that same amount of heat to the surroundings.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="section" id="section-5-6">
    <h2>5.6 Hess’s Law</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Enthalpy is a state function, so the enthalpy change for a given reaction is path independent; you can add or reverse individual steps to obtain the target reaction.</li>
      <li>Hess’s law lets you calculate ΔH for complex reactions by combining known ΔH values for simpler reactions.</li>
      <li>Manipulating equations (reversing, multiplying, canceling) carries their ΔH values along with the same operations.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Hess’s law</strong> <code>ΔH<sub>target</sub> = Σ ΔH<sub>steps</sub></code>
      <p>Add the enthalpy changes of the intermediate reactions that sum to the overall reaction. Reversing a step flips the sign of its ΔH; multiplying by a factor multiplies ΔH.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">To find the enthalpy for CH₄ + 2 O₂ → CO₂ + 2 H₂O, add ΔH of CH₄ combustion to CO₂ formation and subtract the ΔH of water condensation if you split the process into known steps.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="section" id="section-5-7">
    <h2>5.7 Enthalpies of Formation</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The standard enthalpy of formation ΔH<sub>f</sub>⁰ is the enthalpy change when one mole of a compound forms from its elements in their standard states.</li>
      <li>Standard enthalpies (with the superscript °) use 1 atm pressure and 298 K temperature.</li>
      <li>Using tabulated ΔH<sub>f</sub>⁰ values makes it easy to compute reaction enthalpies for systems that are hard to study directly.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Standard reaction enthalpy</strong> <code>ΔH° = Σ n ΔH<sub>f</sub>⁰(products) - Σ n ΔH<sub>f</sub>⁰(reactants)</code>
      <p>The sum over products minus the sum over reactants gives ΔH° for the reaction. Multiply each ΔH<sub>f</sub>⁰ by its coefficient <em>n</em> in the balanced equation.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">The standard enthalpy of formation for water vapor is ΔH<sub>f</sub>⁰ = -241.8 kJ/mol. To compute the combustion enthalpy of H₂, combine ΔH<sub>f</sub>⁰ of H₂O (products) and subtract those of the elements (zeros) to get ΔH° = -286 kJ/mol (approx).</p>
  </section>
  <section class="section" id="section-5-8">
    <h2>5.8 Bond Enthalpies</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Average bond enthalpies quantify the energy required to homolytically break a bond in a gaseous molecule.</li>
      <li>The reaction enthalpy approximated by bond enthalpies equals the energy cost to break bonds minus the energy released forming new bonds.</li>
      <li>Stronger bonds have higher bond enthalpies; multiple bonds release more energy than single bonds when formed.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Bond enthalpy estimate</strong> <code>ΔH<sub>rxn</sub> ≈ Σ D(bonds broken) - Σ D(bonds formed)</code>
      <p>Breaking bonds consumes energy (positive contributions), forming bonds releases energy. Use average bond enthalpies for the specific bonds in reactants and products.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">Breaking four C–H bonds in CH₄ costs about 4 × 413 = 1652 kJ, and forming the appropriate bonds in products gives another total; their difference approximates ΔH of the reaction.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="section" id="section-5-9">
    <h2>5.9 Foods and Fuels</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Chemical energy in fuels and foods comes from combustion that converts C–H and C–C bonds to CO₂ and H₂O, releasing large negative ΔH.</li>
      <li>Fuel value is the energy released per gram or per mole when a substance combusts; fats, carbohydrates, and proteins have different caloric densities.</li>
      <li>Food labels report kilocalories, where 1 Calorie (capital C) = 4184 J, so monitoring intake relates to the enthalpy of digestion (metabolism) of glucose or fat.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Fuel value</strong> <code>Fuel value ≈ ΔH<sub>combustion</sub> per gram</code>
      <p>Combustion enthalpy per gram gives the energy density of fuels or foods. For example, fats release ~38 kJ/g while carbohydrates ~17 kJ/g; these normalized values guide dietary planning and energy engineering.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">Glucose combustion (C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6 O₂ → 6 CO₂ + 6 H₂O) liberates about 2800 kJ/mol. Eating one mole of glucose thus releases roughly the same energy as burning that mole in a calorimeter, explaining why blood glucose feeds cells with chemical energy.</p>
