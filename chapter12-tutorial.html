    <h1>Chapter 12 Tutorial — Solids and Modern Materials</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>12.1 Classification of Solids</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Solids are classified by predominant bonding: metallic, ionic, covalent-network, molecular, plus polymers and nanomaterials.</li>
        <li>Crystalline solids have repeating unit cells and lattice scaffolds; amorphous solids lack long-range order.</li>
        <li>Seven primitive 3D lattices (triclinic, monoclinic, orthorhombic, tetragonal, rhombohedral, hexagonal, cubic) plus centered variants describe how unit cells tile space.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Density formula:</strong> <code>ρ = (n·M)/(N_A·V_cell)</code> links density to the number of formula units per cell, molar mass, Avogadro’s number, and cell volume.</li>
        <li><strong>Bragg’s law:</strong> <code>nλ = 2d sin θ</code> (qualitative). X-ray diffraction gives lattice spacings <code>d</code>, so constructive interference identifies crystal structure.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>NaCl fills an FCC lattice; plugging its `n=4`, `M=58.44 g/mol`, and lattice parameter into the density formula yields the experimental density ≈ 2.16 g/cm³.</p>

      <h2>12.2 Metallic Solids</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Metallic bonding consists of atoms embedded in a sea of delocalized valence electrons, producing conductivity and ductility.</li>
        <li>Close-packed structures (FCC, HCP) maximize atom packing efficiency (~74%) and are common in metals; BCC is also prevalent (e.g., iron).</li>
        <li>Band theory explains easy electron flow: partially filled bands allow electrons to drift under an electric field.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Packing efficiency:</strong> FCC and HCP pack spheres at ~74%, so 3/4 of the volume is occupied by atoms, giving high density.</li>
        <li><strong>Conductivity relation:</strong> <code>σ ∝ n_e·μ</code>. Higher density of delocalized electrons and mobility leads to better conductivity.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Copper adopts an FCC lattice with atoms at corners and faces, enabling electrons to move freely and making copper a top electrical conductor.</p>

      <h2>12.3 Ionic Solids</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Ionic solids consist of alternating cations and anions held by strong electrostatic attraction, yielding hardness, brittleness, and high melting points.</li>
        <li>Coordination numbers depend on ionic size ratios; common structures include NaCl (6:6) and CsCl (8:8).</li>
        <li>Lattice energy quantifies the electrostatic stabilization and explains thermal stability.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lattice energy (Coulombic):</strong> <code>U ∝ (|q⁺q⁻|)/(r⁺ + r⁻)</code>; higher charges and smaller ions lead to larger negative lattice energies (stronger binding).</li>
        <li><strong>Density via unit cell:</strong> Same formula as Section 12.1; e.g., NaCl’s FCC cell has four formula units, giving a density consistent with experimental data.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>NaCl’s 3D structure places Na⁺ and Cl⁻ in an FCC lattice; the strong ionic lattice energy (~-787 kJ/mol) explains its 801 °C melting point and brittleness.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>12.4 Covalent Solids</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Covalent-network solids are built from atoms connected by directional covalent bonds throughout, making them extremely hard (e.g., diamond, quartz).</li>
        <li>Bonding rigidity leads to high melting points and low electrical conductivity unless doped (as in semiconductors like silicon).</li>
        <li>The motif may not sit on lattice points; diamond’s basis has two tetrahedrally bonded carbons per primitive cubic cell.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bond energy:</strong> Breaking covalent bonds (~400 kJ/mol) costs far more energy than intermolecular attractions, yielding high heats of fusion/vaporization.</li>
        <li><strong>Coordination number:</strong> Each carbon in diamond bonds to four neighbors (tetrahedral), giving a rigid network responsible for its hardness and melting point near 3500 °C.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Diamond’s cubic lattice has each carbon covalently bonded in a tetrahedral motif, producing a transparent, superhard material used in cutting tools.</p>

      <h2>12.5 Polymers</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Polymers are macromolecules composed of covalently bonded repeating units; intermolecular forces between chains govern bulk properties.</li>
        <li>Chain entanglement and cross-linking raise viscosity, tensile strength, and melting temperature.</li>
        <li>Thermoplastics soften with heat (chains slide past each other), while thermosets (cross-linked) cannot be remelted.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Degree of polymerization:</strong> <code>n = M_polymer / M_monomer</code>; larger `n` means longer chains, higher molecular weight, and stronger mechanical properties.</li>
        <li><strong>Glass transition:</strong> Temperature `T_g` marks where amorphous regions gain mobility; below `T_g` polymers are glassy and brittle, above `T_g` they become rubbery.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Polyethylene (−CH₂−CH₂−)ₙ with high `n` is used for durable containers; lowering `n` yields waxy, low-melt materials.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>12.6 Nanomaterials</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Nanomaterials have at least one dimension in the 1–100 nm range, so a large fraction of atoms lie at surfaces, altering melting points, reactivity, and optical/electronic properties.</li>
        <li>Quantum confinement raises bandgap energies as size decreases, enabling tunable optical properties (e.g., quantum dots).</li>
        <li>Surface-area-to-volume ratio increases inversely with size, enhancing catalysis and interactions with environments.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Surface-area-to-volume:</strong> For spheres, <code>SA/V ∝ 1/r</code>; halving radius doubles surface atoms, improving catalytic activity.</li>
        <li><strong>Quantum confinement:</strong> In a particle-in-a-box model <code>E ∝ h²/(2m r²)</code>, so smaller radius `r` increases energy gaps, shifting absorption/emission to higher energies (bluer light).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>TiO₂ nanoparticles remain transparent while surfacing more UV-active due to the high surface area, explaining their use in sunscreens and photocatalysis.</p>
