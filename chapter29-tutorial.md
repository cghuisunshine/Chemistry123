# Chapter 29 Tutorial — Carboxylic Acids and Their Derivatives

## 29.1 Carboxylic Acids

### Key ideas
- The carboxyl group (COOH) merges a carbonyl and hydroxyl attached to an sp2 carbon, giving both resonance-stabilized conjugate bases and strong hydrogen-bonding at the OH that raises boiling points and water solubility for small acids.
- The acidity of RCOOH (pKa ~4-5 for acetic acid) stems from the stable carboxylate anion; resonance over two equivalent O atoms spreads negative charge, making the conjugate base far less reactive than the alkoxide from the corresponding alcohol (pKa ~16).
- Inductive effects tune acidity: electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., Cl) near the COOH weaken the O-H bond (lowering pKa), and reacting with bases or amines makes soluble salts that aid drug delivery or formulation.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Acid dissociation:** `RCOOH + H2O -> RCOO- + H3O+` (Equation 29.1). The carboxyl carbon pulls electron density toward both oxygens; when the O-H bond breaks, the negative charge spreads over both O atoms, which is why carboxylic acids are weak acids whose pKa values sit near 4–5.
- **Carboxylate resonance:** `[R-C(=O)-O-] <-> [R-CO(-1)-O=];` this resonance explains why the conjugate base is stabilized and why molecules like acetic acid are much stronger acids than ethanol.
- **Base neutralization:** `RCOOH + NaOH -> RCOONa + H2O` (Equation 29.2). Salt formation increases aqueous solubility, so pharmaceuticals are often delivered as carboxylate or ammonium salts (e.g., acetate + ethylamine -> ethylammonium acetate [29.4]).
- **Bicarbonate reaction:** `RCOOH + NaHCO3 -> RCOONa + CO2 + H2O` (Equation 29.3). The evolution of CO2 is a convenient test for acids (e.g., in effervescent tablets) and shows carbonate salts release gas when acidified.

### Short example(s)
- Acetic acid (CH3COOH) dissolves in water and donates a proton to water to make acetate; adding NaOH gives sodium acetate, which is more soluble and used in buffers.
- Mixing acetic acid with ethanol in the presence of acid makes ethyl acetate (Fischer esterification, Section 29.3) while reacting with NaHCO3 effervesces CO2, illustrating acidity and salt behavior.

## 29.2 Preparation of Carboxylic Acids

### Key ideas
- Oxidizing primary alcohols (or aldehydes) with strong oxidants (K2Cr2O7/H2SO4, KMnO4) converts them to carboxylic acids; aldehydes that form along the way are quickly over-oxidized, so stopping at the acid requires careful control.
- Industrial acetic acid comes from carbonylation of methanol (`CH3OH + CO -> CH3COOH`, Equation 29.5) with a rhodium catalyst, while benzoic acid forms by oxidizing toluene or via phenylmagnesium bromide plus CO2.
- Functional-group interconversion routes (hydrolyzing esters, amides, nitriles) and Grignard addition to dry ice are reliable ways to extend carbon chains to acids.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Alcohol oxidation:** `RCH2OH + [O] -> RCOOH + H2O`. Strong oxidizing agents attack the primary carbon, eventually forming the carboxyl group; this is why ethanol exposed to air or acid turns into acetic acid (vinegar).
- **Carbonylation:** `CH3OH + CO -> CH3COOH` (Equation 29.5). The CO inserts between the methyl and hydroxyl; the process is highly efficient for making acetic acid at scale.
- **Grignard + CO2:** `R-MgX + CO2 -> RCOO-MgX -> H3O+ -> RCOOH` (Equation 29.10). Carbon dioxide acts as an electrophile, so nucleophilic carbanions add to it, and protonation delivers the carboxylic acid with one extra carbon.
- **Hydrolysis sources:** esters/amide/nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions (Equations 29.11–29.13) to regenerate RCOOH, which chemists use to cleave protecting groups or produce acids from simpler precursors.

### Short example(s)
- Oxidation of pentan-1-ol with acidic dichromate produces pentanoic acid, giving a longer-chain acid starting from the alcohol (Equation 29.6).
- Treating 1-bromobutane with Mg/ether, then CO2, and finally acid yields pentanoic acid (Sample Exercise 29.2), showing how Grignard chemistry extends carbon chains.

## 29.3 Esters and Esterification

### Key ideas
- Esters `RCOOR'` form when a carboxylic acid condenses with an alcohol under acid catalysis (Fischer esterification); the alcohol portion gives the “alkyl” name and the acid the “-oate” suffix.
- The reaction is reversible; adding water or using dilute acid shifts equilibrium back to acids and alcohols, making esters useful as temporary protecting groups.
- Basic hydrolysis (saponification) cleaves esters to carboxylate salts and alcohols, underpinning soap manufacture and flavor chemistry.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Esterification:** `RCOOH + R'OH <-> RCOOR' + H2O` (Equation 29.14). The acid catalyst protonates the carbonyl, allowing the alcohol to attack; removing water or using excess alcohol drives the equilibrium to ester formation.
- **Acidic hydrolysis:** `RCOOR' + H2O -> RCOOH + R'OH`. Reintroducing water shifts the equilibrium back, regenerating the acid and alcohol; this reversibility is the basis for protecting carboxyl groups.
- **Saponification (base hydrolysis):** `RCOOR' + OH- -> RCOO- + R'OH` (Equation 29.16). The base produces a soluble carboxylate salt, and upon acidification the free acid returns; soaps exploit the amphiphilic salt to emulsify grease.

### Short example(s)
- Ethyl acetate forms from acetic acid and ethanol, giving a sweet-smelling ester used in nail polish remover (Figure 29.5 and Equation 29.14).
- Saponifying methyl propionate with NaOH yields sodium propionate and methanol (Equation 29.16), a reaction analogous to how soap producers cleave fats.

## 29.4 Fats, Oils, and Waxes

### Key ideas
- Lipids encompass hydrophobic esters such as waxes (fatty acid + long alcohol) and triglycerides (glycerol + three fatty acids); their nonpolar alkyl chains dominate their solubility and melting behavior.
- Saturated fatty acids pack tightly and give solid fats (e.g., stearic acid); unsaturated chains introduce kinks, lower melting points (oils), and allow hydrogenation (hardening) to make margarines.
- Saponification of triglycerides with strong base creates soap (carboxylate salts), and detergents replace carboxylate heads with sulfonate groups to avoid scum formation in hard water.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Triglyceride formation:** `glycerol + 3 RCOOH -> glycerol triester + 3 H2O`. Each ester link removes water, building a triester whose long chains give the characteristic lipid texture.
- **Saponification:** `triglyceride + 3 NaOH -> glycerol + 3 RCOONa` (Equation 29.17). The carboxylate salts act as soaps—micelles form with hydrophobic tails inside and hydrophilic heads outside to emulsify oils (Figure 29.8).
- **Hydrogenation (hardening):** `C=C + H2 -> C-C` across the unsaturated fatty chains. Partial hydrogenation increases saturation, raising melting points to turn oils into fats while controlling trans isomer formation.
- **Soap scum formation:** `2 RCOO- + Ca2+ -> (RCOO)2Ca` (Equation 29.18); detergents avoid that by using sulfonate heads whose calcium salts remain soluble.

### Short example(s)
- Vegetable oils (rich in oleic/linoleic acids) are hydrogenated to margarine by adding hydrogen across double bonds, making the triglyceride solid at room temperature.
- Classic soap-making boils animal fat with NaOH: the triglyceride saponifies to glycerol plus sodium stearate, which forms micelles to clean greasy grime.

## 29.5 Acid Chlorides, Anhydrides, and Nucleophilic Acyl Substitution

### Key ideas
- Reactive acyl derivatives (acid chlorides and anhydrides) form from carboxylic acids (e.g., RCOOH + SOCl2 -> RCOCl + SO2 + HCl) and allow selective transformation without affecting other functional groups, a strategy used for protecting groups in complex synthesis.
- Nucleophilic acyl substitution occurs when Nu- adds to the carbonyl of RCOY (Y = Cl, OR, OCOR), forming a tetrahedral intermediate that collapses to expel Y- and give esters, amides, or acids depending on the nucleophile.
- Esters react further with strong nucleophiles (e.g., Grignard reagents or hydride) because the intermediate regenerates an electrophilic ketone, so two equivalents are used to reach stable tertiary or primary alcohols.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Acid chloride formation:** `RCOOH + SOCl2 -> RCOCl + SO2 + HCl` (Equation 29.20). Thionyl chloride replaces the hydroxyl with Cl, making a much more electrophilic acyl halide useful for downstream substitutions.
- **Nucleophilic acyl substitution:** `RCOY + Nu- -> RCONu + Y-` (Equation 29.23). The tetrahedral intermediate ejects Y- (a good leaving group) and regenerates a carbonyl with the new nucleophile attached, enabling conversions to amides, esters, anhydrides, etc.
- **Grignard addition to esters:** `RCOOR' + 2 RMgX -> tertiary alkoxide -> H3O+ -> tertiary alcohol` (Equations 29.24–29.25). The first equivalent makes a ketone, which reacts again because it is reactive, so two equivalents are required to avoid mixtures.
- **Hydride reduction:** `RCOOR' + LiAlH4 -> RCH2OH` (via aldehyde intermediate, Equations 29.26–29.27). Controlled hydride delivery yields primary alcohols; esters act as precursors to both aldehydes and alcohols.

### Short example(s)
- Butanoic acid treated with SOCl2 gives butanoyl chloride, which then reacts with ethanol to form ethyl butanoate without affecting other groups (Equations 29.20 and 29.21).
- Adding excess phenylmagnesium bromide to ethyl benzoate yields a tertiary alcohol after acidic workup (Sample Exercise 29.3), showing how nucleophilic acyl substitution follows through to alcohols.

## 29.6 Condensation Polymerization

### Key ideas
- Condensation (step-growth) polymerization links difunctional monomers, one bond at a time, releasing small molecules (e.g., water); polyesters come from diacids/diols and polyamides from diacids/diamines.
- PET (polyethylene terephthalate, Dacron) is a polyester widely used in textiles and medical devices; nylon 6,6 arises from adipic acid and hexamethylenediamine, while nylon 6 derives from caprolactam ring opening and condensation.
- Copolymers alternate monomers (A-B-A-B) for nylon 6,6, whereas nylon 6 has repeating single monomer units (A-A-A) from the same monomer.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Polyester formation:** `n dimethyl terephthalate + n ethylene glycol -> PET + 2n H2O` (Equation 29.28). Ester links connect repeating units, and removing water drives the polymerization.
- **Polyamide formation (nylon 6,6):** `n hexamethylenediamine + n adipic acid -> nylon 6,6 + 2n H2O` (Equation 29.29). Amide bonds (CONH) join the chains, giving strong, heat-resistant fibers.
- **Ring-opening (nylon 6):** `e-caprolactam + heat + H2O -> nylon 6` forms a single monomer polymerized via amide linkages; using a single monomer gives the single-digit notation (6) in the name.

### Short example(s)
- Dacron (PET) fibers for heart-valve rings arise from ethylene glycol and dimethyl terephthalate heated to condense water (Equation 29.28), showcasing the biocompatibility of polar oxygen linkages.
- Nylon 6,6 is formed from adipic acid and hexamethylene diamine (Equation 29.29), giving the 6,6 naming and providing materials for apparel, carpets, and ropes.
