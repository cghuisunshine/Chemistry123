# Chapter 13 Tutorial — Properties of Solutions

## 13.1 The Solution Process
### Key ideas
- Solutions form when solute particles disperse evenly throughout a solvent, driven by entropy (mixing) but moderated by intermolecular interactions.
- Three energetic steps control dissolution: breaking solute–solute and solvent–solvent interactions (endothermic) and forming solute–solvent attractions (exothermic).
- Solution spontaneity depends on whether the favorable solute–solvent interactions compensate for the energy costs of separating particles.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Enthalpy of solution:** `ΔH_soln = ΔH_solute + ΔH_solvent + ΔH_mix` (Equation 13.1). The total heat change equals the sum of costs to separate solute and solvent plus the energy released as they interact, so modest ΔH_mix can make an endothermic process viable.
- **Ion–dipole orientation:** Polar solvents orient their partial charges toward ions (Na⁺ surrounded by oxygen, Cl⁻ by hydrogen in water), maximizing solvation enthalpy and allowing salts to dissolve.

### Short example(s)
- NaCl dissolves in water because ion–dipole attractions outweigh the lattice enthalpy and water–water interactions, producing a slightly endothermic solution (`ΔH_soln ≈ +3.9 kJ/mol`).

## 13.2 Saturated Solutions and Solubility
### Key ideas
- A saturated solution contains the maximum amount of solute that can dissolve at a given temperature and pressure; additional solute will remain undissolved.
- Solubility depends on temperature and (for gases) pressure; solids usually become more soluble with heat while gases become less soluble.
- Dynamic equilibrium exists in a saturated solution, with equal rates of dissolution and crystallization.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Solubility expression:** `m = s` for unsaturated, `s =  solute/solvent` (g or mol per 100 g water or per liter) quantifies how much solute dissolves; the solubility curve gives `s(T)`.
- **Henry’s law (gases):** `P_gas = k_H · [gas]` meaning gas solubility in a liquid rises linearly with pressure times a constant `k_H`.

### Short example(s)
- Carbon dioxide solubility in soda is high under the bottle’s pressure; once opened, pressure drops and CO₂ effuses until the solution becomes unsaturated, producing fizz.

## 13.3 Factors Affecting Solubility
### Key ideas
- Molecular similarity (“like dissolves like”) makes polar solvents dissolve polar solutes via dipole interactions, while nonpolar solvents rely on dispersion forces.
- Temperature typically increases the solubility of solids (more kinetic energy to overcome lattice forces) but decreases that of gases (higher kinetic energy lets gas escape).
- Pressure has little effect on solids but significantly increases gas solubility (Henry’s law).

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Ratio of solubilities:** Polar vs nonpolar solutes align with bond energies; a solute with strong intermolecular attractions needs a solvent that can match them for dissolution.
- **Le Chatelier’s principle:** Raising temperature shifts the dissolution equilibria depending on `ΔH_soln`: endothermic dissolutions become more soluble with heat, exothermic ones less so.

### Short example(s)
- Sugar dissolves faster in hot water because thermal motion helps break sugar–sugar hydrogen bonds, while O₂ becomes less soluble in warm lakes as temperature rises.

## 13.4 Expressing Solution Concentration
### Key ideas
- Common concentration units include mass percent, molarity (mol/L), molality (mol/kg solvent), mole fraction, and parts per million/billion.
- Each unit suits specific scenarios: molarity for reactions in solutions, molality for colligative properties (no volume change with temperature), and mole fraction for gas-phase mixtures.
- Care must be taken to use consistent units—molarity depends on solution volume, so it changes with temperature.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Molarity:** `M = n_solute/V_solution (mol/L)` describes moles of solute per liter of solution.
- **Molality:** `m = n_solute/m_solvent (mol/kg)` is independent of temperature-driven volume changes and enters colligative property formulas.
- **Mole fraction:** `X_i = n_i/Σn_j` gives the ratio of moles of component `i` to the total and determines partial pressures (Section 10.5).

### Short example(s)
- A solution with 0.50 mol NaCl in 0.25 L has `M = 2.0 M`, while the same solute in 0.20 kg water has `m = 2.5 m`; temperature shifts impact M but not m.

## 13.5 Colligative Properties
### Key ideas
- Colligative properties depend on the number of dissolved particles, not their identity: lowering vapor pressure, elevating boiling point, depressing freezing point, and generating osmotic pressure.
- Each property reflects how solute particles disrupt the solvent’s tendency to escape or freeze, changing phase equilibria.
- Nonvolatile solutes reduce solvent vapor pressure proportionally to their mole fraction.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Raoult’s law for ideal solutions:** `P_solution = X_solvent·P°_solvent`, so each solute particle reduces the solvent’s partial pressure.
- **Boiling point elevation:** `ΔT_b = K_b·m` and **freezing point depression:** `ΔT_f = K_f·m`, where `m` is molality and `K` constants depend on the solvent; more particles (including van ’t Hoff factor `i`) cause larger shifts.
- **Osmotic pressure:** `Π = M·R·T` for dilute solutions; it is the pressure required to stop solvent flow through a semipermeable membrane.

### Short example(s)
- Dissolving 1 mol of NaCl in water yields roughly `i = 2` particles, so the boiling point increases by `ΔT_b = K_b·m·i`, making saltwater boil above 100 °C.
- Osmosis makes fresh water flow into a salt solution; applying `Π = MRT` estimates the pressure needed to prevent it.

## 13.6 Colloids
### Key ideas
- Colloidal dispersions contain particles between 1 nm and 1 μm; they do not settle and scatter light (Tyndall effect) due to particle size.
- Colloids differ from true solutions because the dispersed phase is large enough to experience Brownian motion but too small to settle by gravity.
- Stabilizing charged layers, steric barriers, or surfactants prevents aggregation and keeps colloids dispersed.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Tyndall effect:** Scattering intensity ∝ particle size², so colloids appear cloudy while solutions remain transparent; lasers reveal the beam path.
- **Zeta potential (qualitative):** A measure of particle surface charge; high zeta potential prevents aggregation, maintaining colloidal stability.

### Short example(s)
- Milk is a colloid (fat droplets dispersed in water); its whiteness arises from the Tyndall effect, and emulsifiers coat droplets to prevent coalescence.
