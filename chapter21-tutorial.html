      <h2>21.1 Radioactivity and Nuclear Equations</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Nuclear chemistry focuses on changes that start in the nucleus as unstable atoms emit particles or photons to lower their energy.</li>
        <li>Isotopes share an atomic number (proton count) but have different mass numbers (total protons plus neutrons), so notation such as <sup>238</sup><sub>92</sub>U shows both values.</li>
        <li>Nuclides are nuclei with a fixed proton and neutron count, radionuclides are radioactive nuclides, and the atoms that contain them are radioisotopes.</li>
        <li>Nuclear equations must balance mass numbers and atomic numbers because nucleons and charge are conserved.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Balanced equation form (alpha emission):</strong> A<sub>Z</sub>X → A−4<sub>Z−2</sub>Y + <sup>4</sup><sub>2</sub>He. The reactant and products carry equal mass and atomic numbers, and the helium nucleus brings two protons and two neutrons.</li>
        <li><strong>Beta emission:</strong> n → p + e⁻ (or <sub>0</sub><sup>1</sup>n → <sub>1</sub><sup>1</sup>H + <sub>-1</sub><sup>0</sup>e). A neutron becomes a proton, so the atomic number increases by 1 while the mass number stays the same.</li>
        <li><strong>Positron emission:</strong> p → n + e⁺ (or <sub>1</sub><sup>1</sup>H → <sub>0</sub><sup>1</sup>n + <sub>1</sub><sup>0</sup>e). A proton converts to a neutron and releases a positively charged electron.</li>
        <li><strong>Electron capture:</strong> A nucleus absorbs an orbital electron (<sub>-1</sub><sup>0</sup>e) so a proton becomes a neutron, leaving the mass number unchanged while the atomic number drops by one.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p><sup>226</sup><sub>88</sub>Ra → <sup>222</sup><sub>86</sub>Rn + <sup>4</sup><sub>2</sub>He shows alpha decay: both sides have mass number 226 and atomic number 88, and radon-222 emerges with four fewer nucleons.</p>

      <h2>21.2 Patterns of Nuclear Stability</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The belt of stability plots proton number versus neutron number; nuclei near it are stable, while neutron or proton excess pushes nuclides into radioactivity.</li>
        <li>Light elements stay stable with an n/p ratio near 1:1, but heavier ones need more neutrons (up toward ~1.5) to offset proton–proton repulsion.</li>
        <li>Even numbers of protons or neutrons give extra stability, so odd/odd nuclei are overrepresented among radionuclides, and no stable isotopes exist above Z = 83.</li>
        <li>Predict decay by seeing where a nuclide sits: neutron-rich nuclei tend to emit beta particles, proton-rich ones emit positrons or capture electrons, and very heavy nuclides favor alpha emission.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Neutron to proton guidance:</strong> Stable n/p ≈ 1 for Z ≤ 20, increasing toward ≈1.5 for heavy nuclei; the ratio has no units but tells you whether a nuclide sits above (neutron-rich) or below (proton-rich) the belt of stability.</li>
        <li><strong>Decay-type shifts:</strong></li>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Alpha:</strong> ΔZ = −2, ΔA = −4; the nucleus loses an alpha particle (⁴₂He).</li>
          <li><strong>Beta:</strong> ΔZ = +1, ΔA = 0; a neutron becomes a proton + electron.</li>
          <li><strong>Positron:</strong> ΔZ = −1, ΔA = 0; a proton becomes a neutron + positron.</li>
          <li><strong>Electron capture:</strong> ΔZ = −1, ΔA = 0; the nucleus grabs an inner electron and turns a proton into a neutron.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>These arithmetic shifts keep mass constant but move nuclei along the proton axis so they approach the belt of stability.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Technetium-99m is near the belt; instead of emitting alpha or beta particles it simply gives off gamma rays to dump excess energy, keeping the proton and neutron counts the same while the nucleus relaxes to the stable ground state.</p>

      <h2>21.3 Rates of Radioactive Decay</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Radioactive decay is first-order, so each nuclide has a constant half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) independent of external conditions.</li>
        <li>Half-lives stretch from microseconds for synthetic isotopes to billions of years (e.g., <sup>238</sup><sub>92</sub>U), making long-lived radionuclides observable in nature and short-lived ones detectable only in experiments.</li>
        <li>Radiometric dating treats t<sub>1/2</sub> as a nuclear clock—carbon-14 for organic samples and uranium-lead for rocks, for example.</li>
        <li>Activity (decays/time) scales with the number of nuclei; 1 becquerel (Bq) equals one decay per second, while 1 curie (Ci) equals 3.7×10¹⁰ decays per second.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rate = kN:</strong> The decay constant k (s⁻¹ or yr⁻¹) times the current number of radioactive nuclei N gives the activity (disintegrations per unit time).</li>
        <li><strong>k = 0.693 / t<sub>1/2</sub>:</strong> The dimensionless ln(2) relates half-life to the decay constant; longer half-lives yield smaller k and vice versa.</li>
        <li><strong>ln(Nₜ/N₀) = −k t:</strong> The log of the remaining fraction equals −k times elapsed time, so knowing any two of N₀, Nₜ, t, or k determines the fourth.</li>
        <li><strong>Activity ratios:</strong> Nt/N0 can represent either the remaining mass or activity because both scale linearly with the number of nuclei; for example, 5 mCi left of an initial 15 mCi gives Nt/N0 = 0.333.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>1.000 mg of <sup>60</sup><sub>27</sub>Co (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 5.27 yr) decays to 0.125 mg after 15.81 yr (three half-lives): each half-life halves the amount, so 1.000 → 0.500 → 0.250 → 0.125 mg and the activity falls to 12.5% of the start.</p>

      <h2>21.4 Detection of Radioactivity</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Film badges darken because ionizing radiation fogs photographic emulsions, giving a straightforward visual record of cumulative exposure.</li>
        <li>Geiger counters count ionizing events: radiation ionizes a gas (e.g., argon), current pulses run between the cathode and the central anode, and the pulse rate tracks the radiation level.</li>
        <li>Scintillation counters use phosphor crystals (like ZnS) to emit light when struck by radiation; photomultiplier tubes amplify the flashes so even gamma rays can be detected.</li>
        <li>Radiotracers take advantage of identical chemical behavior for isotopes; inserting a radioisotope lets us follow the same element through reactions or physiology without changing its chemistry.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>PET signature:</strong> e⁺ + e⁻ → 2 γ (two 511 keV gamma rays in opposite directions). Detecting the coincident gammas pinpoints the decay site and lets scanners reconstruct metabolic activity.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Carbon-11 attached to glucose decays by positron emission; when the positron annihilates with an electron it produces two oppositely directed gamma rays and a PET scanner maps where the brain metabolized the tracer.</p>

      <h2>21.5 Energy Changes in Nuclear Reactions</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Einstein’s E = mc² shows how a small mass loss (m) can release enormous energy (E), because c is the speed of light (≈ 3.00×10⁸ m/s) squared.</li>
        <li>The mass defect (difference between separate nucleon masses and the nuclear mass) becomes the nuclear binding energy that holds the nucleus together.</li>
        <li>Binding energy per nucleon peaks near iron-56; splitting heavy nuclei (fission) or combining light ones (fusion) moves toward that peak and releases energy.</li>
        <li>Uranium-235 fission produces 2–3 neutrons per event, so a chain reaction is possible; moderators (water or graphite) slow neutrons, and control rods (boron or cadmium) absorb extras to keep reactors critical but stable.</li>
        <li>Fusion (e.g., ¹H + ¹H → ²H + e⁺ + ν) powers stars but requires temperatures of 10⁷–10⁸ K to overcome electrostatic repulsion between positively charged nuclei.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>∆E = ∆m c²:</strong> The energy change equals the mass defect (in kilograms) times the square of the speed of light, giving joules of energy released or absorbed.</li>
        <li><strong>Mass defect:</strong> ∆m = Σm(products) − Σm(reactants). Usually expressed in atomic mass units (u), then converted to kilograms (1 u = 1.6605×10⁻²⁷ kg) before using E = mc².</li>
        <li><strong>Fission energy:</strong> Splitting <sup>235</sup><sub>92</sub>U into <sup>141</sup><sub>56</sub>Ba, <sup>92</sup><sub>36</sub>Kr, and three neutrons releases about 3.5×10⁻¹¹ J per nucleus (≈ 200 MeV), so splitting a mole of nuclei releases ~2×10¹³ J.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>When <sup>235</sup><sub>92</sub>U absorbs a slow neutron it splits into <sup>141</sup><sub>56</sub>Ba, <sup>92</sup><sub>36</sub>Kr, and 3 neutrons; those neutrons can trigger more fissions, so control rods and moderators keep the chain reaction steady while the released heat powers turbines.</p>

      <h2>21.6 Radiation in the Environment and Living Systems</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Natural background radiation (cosmic rays, rocks, radon, and isotopes such as potassium-40) contributes about 3.6 mSv per year in the U.S., with radon accounting for roughly 2 mSv.</li>
        <li>Ionizing radiation can strip electrons from water, forming reactive hydroxyl radicals that damage DNA and other biomolecules, possibly causing cancer.</li>
        <li>Alpha particles are most dangerous inside the body because they deposit large energy over a short path; gamma rays penetrate deeply, so shielding is critical.</li>
        <li>Radiation therapy treats tumors with gamma rays from isotopes like <sup>60</sup><sub>27</sub>Co or <sup>131</sup><sub>53</sub>I, squeezing the dose on the tumor while sparing normal tissue via shielding and precise targeting.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hydroxyl radical formation:</strong> H₂O⁺ + H₂O → H₃O⁺ + ·OH. Ionizing radiation strips an electron from water and the resulting cation quickly makes a hydroxyl radical, which can harm biological molecules.</li>
        <li><strong>Effective dose:</strong> rem = rad × RBE. Multiply the absorbed dose (rad, where 1 rad = 0.01 J/kg) by the radiation’s relative biological effectiveness (RBE ≈ 1 for beta/gamma, ≈ 10 for alpha) to account for differing damage.</li>
        <li><strong>Sievert conversion:</strong> 1 Sv = 100 rem. The sievert is the SI equivalent of rem, so it already includes damage weighting and uses joule-based units.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>A dental X-ray (≈5 mSv) is far below a lethal 6 Sv dose, while potassium-40 in 1.00 g of KCl contains 9.45×10¹⁷ ⁴⁰K ions; only 0.0117% are the radioactive isotope, so it takes ~1.9×10⁷ years for 1% to decay and its radiation is a steady part of background exposure.</p>
