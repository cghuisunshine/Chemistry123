# Chapter 26 Tutorial — Chemistry of Alkenes and Alkynes

## 26.1 The Structure of Unsaturated Hydrocarbons
### Key ideas
- Alkenes (CnH2n) and alkynes (CnH2n−2) are hydrocarbons that contain C=C or C≡C p bonds, respectively; these p bonds introduce rigidity and greater reactivity than alkanes.
- p-Bonds arise from the sideways overlap of p orbitals above and below the internuclear axis, making them weaker than sigma bonds and preventing free rotation.
- Simple unsaturated molecules like ethene and acetylene serve as building blocks for polymers (e.g., isoprene-derived terpenes), fuels, and reagents.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Alkene formula:** `CnH2n`. Each addition of a CH₂ unit adds two hydrogens while maintaining one double bond.
- **Alkyne formula:** `CnH2n−2`. Triple bonds remove another two hydrogens compared to alkenes by replacing a CH₂ unit with two CH groups.

### Short example(s)
- Ethene (`CH₂=CH₂`) acts as a plant hormone and is the monomer for polyethene, while acetylene (`HC≡CH`) is a high-energy fuel used in welding torches.

## 26.2 Isomerism and Nomenclature
### Key ideas
- Limited rotation around double bonds leads to geometric (E/Z) isomers when each carbon of the C=C bears two different substituents; cycloalkenes and alkenes share molecular formulas with alkynes but differ constitutionally.
- Include the double/triple bond position in the parent name (e.g., pent-1-ene, but-2-yne) and give the lowest possible locant for the unsaturation.
- Terpenes (built from isoprene units) show how nature exploits unsaturation to create complex, biologically active molecules.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Naming rule:** Number the longest chain containing the double or triple bond so the unsaturation has the lowest number, then append `-ene` (double) or `-yne` (triple), e.g., `2-ethyl-3-methylpent-1-ene`.

### Short example(s)
- Pent-2-ene has two geometric isomers: cis (same side) is violet, and trans (opposite sides) is green because different wavelengths are absorbed.

## 26.3 Arrow Notation and Resonance Structures
### Key ideas
- Curved arrows trace electron movement in mechanisms, starting at electron sources (lone pairs or bonds) and ending where electrons go.
- Resonance structures (Lewis contributors) show delocalized electrons; the actual molecule is a hybrid, stabilizing species such as nitromethane and formate by spreading charge.
- Electrophiles (E⁺) accept electron pairs, nucleophiles donate; arrow notation makes mechanisms for additions and substitutions transparent.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **General arrow step:** `Nu: + E → Nu–E`. A nucleophile donates a pair to an electrophile; subsequent steps may regenerate or shuffle charges.

### Short example(s)
- Nitromethane resonance: arrows move a lone pair from one oxygen to form an N=O bond while the remaining bond becomes a lone pair, showing negative charge delocalization.

## 26.4 Electrophilic Addition Reactions
### Key ideas
- Alkenes undergo electrophilic addition (halogenation, hydrohalogenation, hydration) where the double bond first forms a carbocation, then a nucleophile adds.
- Carbocation stability (tertiary > secondary > primary) and Markovnikov’s rule guide regioselectivity; the electrophile attaches to the carbon with more hydrogens.
- Halogenation proceeds via bridged halonium ions, giving trans addition on cyclic alkenes; hydration via H₃O⁺ forms alcohols, while halohydrins add X and OH across the double bond.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Markovnikov’s rule:** In HX addition, `H` attaches to the carbon that already has the most hydrogens; the halogen lands on the more substituted carbon because that carbocation intermediate is more stable.
- **Rate law for hydrohalogenation:** Rate ≈ `k[alkene][HX]` because the slow step involves both the alkene and HX forming the carbocation.

### Short example(s)
- 1-methylcyclohexene treated with HCl yields 1-chloro-1-methylcyclohexane via a tertiary carbocation; bromination gives a vicinal dibromide with anti stereochemistry due to the bromonium intermediate.

## 26.5 Catalytic Hydrogenation
### Key ideas
- Hydrogenation adds H₂ across C=C or C≡C bonds using heterogeneous catalysts (Pt, Pd, Ni); adsorption on the metal surface lowers activation energy.
- Reaction proceeds via adsorption of H₂ and the alkene, sequential addition of hydrogen atoms, and desorption of the saturated alkane.
- Hydrogenation favors cis addition on cyclic alkenes and is used commercially to solidify fats by saturating double bonds.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Hydrogenation example:** `C₂H₄ + H₂ → C₂H₆` (ΔH ~ −137 kJ/mol) catalyzed by Pt; the catalyst provides surface H atoms that add stepwise to the adsorbed alkene.

### Short example(s)
- Hydrogenation of 1,2-dimethylcyclohexene with Pd/C yields the cis-dimethylcyclohexane stereoisomer (cis addition), used in creating margarine from vegetable oils.

## 26.6 Addition Polymerization
### Key ideas
- Polymers form when reactive monomers (alkenes) link via radical chain polymerization (initiation, propagation, termination).
- Radical initiators (e.g., lauroyl peroxide) generate radicals that add to monomers; each addition regenerates a radical center that continues the chain until termination (radical combination).
- Polymer properties (density, rigidity) depend on average molecular weight, branching (LDPE vs. HDPE), crystallinity, and cross-linking (e.g., vulcanized rubber); plasticizers and recycling categories (numbers 1–7) reflect these variations.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Polymer repeat unit:** `n CH₂=CH₂ → (−CH₂−CH₂−)ₙ`. Each ethene adds through its double bond, forming long saturated chains.
- **Polymerization stages:** initiation (radical formation), propagation (radical adds monomers), termination (radicals combine or disproportionate).

### Short example(s)
- Ziegler–Natta catalysts produce HDPE with long, straight chains; radical polymerization gives LDPE with branched chains and lower crystallinity.
