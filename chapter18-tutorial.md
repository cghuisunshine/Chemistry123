# Chapter 18 Tutorial — Chemistry of the Environment

## 18.1 Earth’s Atmosphere
### Key ideas
- The atmosphere is stratified (troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere) by temperature gradients, with most mass in the troposphere/stratosphere.
- Atmospheric pressure decreases exponentially with altitude, and high-energy radiation drives photochemistry in the upper layers.
- Trace gases absorb solar radiation, participate in chemical cycles, and their distribution is influenced by diffusion and solar forcing.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Photodissociation:** `CF₂Cl₂ + hν → CF₂Cl + Cl` (Equation 18.6); UV breaks C–Cl bonds, releasing Cl atoms that catalytically destroy O₃ (Equations 18.7–18.10).
- **Oxygen balance:** Ozone formation `O + O₂ + M → O₃ + M*` (Equation 18.14) is offset by catalytic destruction, so even small Cl concentrations greatly affect ozone via `Cl + O₃ → ClO + O₂`.

### Short example(s)
- Chlorofluorocarbon emissions created the Antarctic ozone hole; the Montreal Protocol phased them out, but recovery takes decades because CFCs persist in the atmosphere.

## 18.2 Human Activities and Earth’s Atmosphere
### Key ideas
- Sulfur and nitrogen oxides from fossil-fuel combustion and high-temperature engines drive acid rain and photochemical smog.
- Acid rain forms when SO₂ oxidizes to SO₃ and reacts with water to make H₂SO₄; nitric oxides from engines form NO₂, which photodissociates to NO + O and leads to O₃ and smog.
- Depletion of ozone opens the door to harmful UV, so limiting CFCs and replacing them with HFCs (with their own greenhouse implications) is vital.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Acid rain acidogenesis:** `SO₂ + ½O₂ → SO₃`, followed by `SO₃ + H₂O → H₂SO₄`; nitric oxide reactions (Equations 18.11–18.14) also supply acid-forming species.
- **Smog initiation:** `NO₂ + hν → NO + O`; the O atom then combines with O₂ to make ground-level ozone (Eq. 18.14).

### Short example(s)
- Lime scrubbers remove SO₂ via `CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂`, then `CaO + SO₂ → CaSO₃` (Figure 18.8) before releasing cleaner exhaust.

## 18.3 Earth’s Water
### Key ideas
- Water cycles through evaporation, condensation, transpiration, precipitation, and runoff; most of Earth’s water is saline ocean water, with a tiny fraction as usable freshwater.
- Oceans have average salinity ≈ 35‰, dominated by Na⁺, Cl⁻, SO₄²⁻, Mg²⁺, Ca²⁺, and K⁺, and they absorb CO₂, maintaining a pH ~8.0–8.3 via carbonate buffering.
- Groundwater resides in aquifers and can be contaminated via leaching from rocks (e.g., arsenic) or from anthropogenic chemicals.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Seawater buffer:** `CO₃²⁻ + H⁺ ↔ HCO₃⁻`; increased atmospheric CO₂ drives this equilibrium to the right, lowering pH (ocean acidification) and reducing carbonate available for shells.
- **Salinity:** grams of dissolved salts per kg of seawater (~35 g/kg), used to calculate concentrations for desalination and marine chemistry.

### Short example(s)
- Oceans absorb ~⅓–½ of human CO₂ emissions, but the resulting acidification (pH drop toward 7.9) dissolves carbonate shells, threatening calcifying organisms.

## 18.4 Human Activities and Water Quality
### Key ideas
- Municipal water treatment uses screening, coagulation/flocculation (Al₂(SO₄)₃), filtration, aeration, and disinfection (chlorine or ozone) to remove particulates and pathogens.
- Disinfection can produce halogenated by-products (THMs, bromate) by reacting chlorine/ozone with natural organics; the benefits outweigh the low risks compared to untreated water.
- Lack of sanitation and polluted runoff (oxygen-demanding wastes, nutrients causing eutrophication) degrade freshwater quality; dissolved O₂ is a key indicator.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Chlorination:** `Cl₂ + H₂O → HClO + H⁺ + Cl⁻` (Equation 18.15); `HClO` oxidizes organics but also forms THMs and, via `HClO + Br⁻ → HBrO + Cl⁻`, bromate.
- **Reverse osmosis:** Pressure must exceed osmotic pressure to force water through a semipermeable membrane, removing salts (Figure 18.18).

### Short example(s)
- A LifeStraw uses sequential filtration, iodine beads, and activated carbon to remove debris, pathogens, and taste from unsafe water.
- Municipal water uses CaO and Al₂(SO₄)₃ to precipitate impurities before final chlorination.

## 18.5 Green Chemistry
### Key ideas
- Green chemistry principles aim to minimize waste, use renewable feedstocks, lower energy use, and design safer chemicals and processes (12 principles summarized in text).
- Examples include one-step styrene synthesis from toluene + methanol, supercritical CO₂ solvents, atom-economical hydroquinone production, and click reactions with high yield and no by-products.
- Catalysts and supercritical fluids reduce waste and energy; alternative feedstocks shift reliance to renewables.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Atom economy:** `(mass of desired product)/(total mass of reactants) × 100%`; high values (close to 100%) indicate efficient use of feedstocks.
- **Arrhenius reduction:** Lowering activation energy via catalysts increases rate constant `k` exponentially and reduces required operating temperature/energy.

### Short example(s)
- Styrene production via toluene + methanol + base at 425 °C eliminates benzene/ethylene feedstocks and recycles hydrogen.
- Click reactions between azides and alkynes in the presence of Cu(I) give nearly quantitative yields with no by-products, exemplifying atom economy.
