  <h1>Chapter 1: Introduction, Matter, Energy, and Measurement</h1>

  <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
  <p>By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Describe how chemistry fits within the scientific method and why measurement is central to the subject.</li>
    <li>Classify matter by state (solid, liquid, gas) and by composition (element, compound, homogeneous mixture, heterogeneous mixture).</li>
    <li>Distinguish clearly between physical vs. chemical properties and changes, using everyday examples.</li>
    <li>Use SI units and metric prefixes correctly, converting between common length, mass, volume, and temperature units.</li>
    <li>Apply significant‑figure rules to measurements, calculated answers, and scientific notation.</li>
    <li>Use dimensional analysis systematically to set up and solve multistep unit‑conversion problems, including density.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Key Vocabulary</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Matter</strong>: anything that has mass and occupies space.</li>
    <li><strong>Element</strong>: substance that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical means.</li>
    <li><strong>Compound</strong>: substance composed of two or more elements in a fixed ratio.</li>
    <li><strong>Mixture</strong>: physical combination of two or more substances; composition may vary.</li>
    <li><strong>Physical property</strong>: can be observed without changing composition (for example, color, melting point).</li>
    <li><strong>Chemical property</strong>: describes how a substance reacts to form new substances (for example, flammability).</li>
    <li><strong>Accuracy</strong>: closeness of a measurement to the true value.</li>
    <li><strong>Precision</strong>: closeness of repeated measurements to each other.</li>
    <li><strong>Significant figures</strong>: digits in a reported value that are known with certainty plus one final estimated digit.</li>
    <li><strong>Density</strong>: mass per unit volume, <code>\rho = m/V</code>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>1. Classification of Matter</h2>
  <h3>States of Matter</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Solids</strong>: particles packed closely; fixed shape and volume; low compressibility.</li>
    <li><strong>Liquids</strong>: particles still close but able to flow; fixed volume but assume shape of container.</li>
    <li><strong>Gases</strong>: particles far apart; neither fixed shape nor fixed volume; highly compressible.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Pure Substances vs Mixtures</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pure substances</strong> have constant composition:
      <ul>
        <li>Elements (for example, O<sub>2</sub>, Cu).</li>
        <li>Compounds (for example, H<sub>2</sub>O, NaCl) with definite ratios.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Mixtures</strong> have variable composition:
      <ul>
        <li>Homogeneous (solutions): uniform throughout (saltwater, air).</li>
        <li>Heterogeneous: non‑uniform (oil and water, salad).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Worked Example 1 – Classifying Matter</h3>
  <p>Classify each as element, compound, homogeneous mixture, or heterogeneous mixture: sugar, brass, orange juice with pulp, oxygen gas.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Sugar (table sugar, sucrose) has fixed composition (C, H, O in a fixed ratio) → <strong>compound</strong>.</li>
    <li>Brass is a uniform solid solution of Cu and Zn → <strong>homogeneous mixture</strong>.</li>
    <li>Orange juice with pulp has visible solid pieces suspended in liquid → <strong>heterogeneous mixture</strong>.</li>
    <li>Oxygen gas (O<sub>2</sub>) is a single element → <strong>element</strong>.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>2. Properties, Changes, and Energy</h2>
  <h3>Physical vs Chemical Changes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Physical changes</strong>: same substance before and after (melting ice, boiling water, dissolving salt in water).</li>
    <li><strong>Chemical changes</strong>: new substances formed (burning, rusting, digestion, gas formation in a reaction).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Energy in Physical and Chemical Processes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Energy can be stored as potential energy (position, composition) or kinetic energy (motion).</li>
    <li>Chemical reactions often involve exchange of energy with surroundings in the form of heat.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Measurement, SI Units, and Prefixes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Base SI units used in general chemistry:
      <ul>
        <li>Length: meter (m).</li>
        <li>Mass: kilogram (kg); in the lab we often use grams (g).</li>
        <li>Time: second (s).</li>
        <li>Temperature: kelvin (K); Celsius (°C) is common in lab.</li>
        <li>Amount of substance: mole (mol).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Common prefixes: kilo (k, 10<sup>3</sup>), centi (c, 10<sup>−2</sup>), milli (m, 10<sup>−3</sup>), micro (µ, 10<sup>−6</sup>), nano (n, 10<sup>−9</sup>).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Worked Example 2 – Unit Prefix Conversion</h3>
  <p>Convert 3.45 km to meters and centimeters.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Write conversion factors: 1 km = 1000 m; 1 m = 100 cm.</li>
    <li>Convert to meters: <code>3.45\,\text{km} \times (1000\,\text{m} / 1\,\text{km}) = 3.45 \times 10^3\,\text{m}</code>.</li>
    <li>Convert to centimeters: <code>3.45 \times 10^3\,\text{m} \times (100\,\text{cm} / 1\,\text{m}) = 3.45 \times 10^5\,\text{cm}</code>.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>4. Significant Figures and Scientific Notation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Counting significant figures</strong>:
      <ul>
        <li>All nonzero digits are significant.</li>
        <li>Zeros between nonzero digits are significant (for example, 101 has three sig figs).</li>
        <li>Leading zeros are never significant (0.0032 has two sig figs).</li>
        <li>Trailing zeros after a decimal point are significant (2.300 has four sig figs).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Calculations</strong>:
      <ul>
        <li>Add/subtract: answer has same number of decimal places as the measurement with the fewest decimal places.</li>
        <li>Multiply/divide: answer has same number of significant figures as the measurement with the fewest significant figures.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Use scientific notation to express very large or small numbers clearly and to match the correct sig figs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Worked Example 3 – Significant Figures</h3>
  <p>Compute (12.53 g + 1.8 g) / 0.055 g and report with correct significant figures.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Add masses: 12.53 g + 1.8 g = 14.33 g → round to 14.3 g (one decimal place, limited by 1.8 g).</li>
    <li>Divide: 14.3 g / 0.055 g ≈ 259.09 (dimensionless).</li>
    <li>Sig figs: 14.3 has three sig figs; 0.055 has two sig figs → answer should have two sig figs.</li>
    <li>Final answer: 2.6 × 10<sup>2</sup>.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>5. Dimensional Analysis and Density</h2>
  <p>Dimensional analysis (factor‑label method) is the default tool for almost every numerical chemistry problem.</p>

  <h3>General Strategy</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Write down the starting quantity with its units.</li>
    <li>Multiply by conversion factors so units cancel, leaving desired units.</li>
    <li>Keep track of significant figures and check if the answer is reasonable.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Density as a Conversion Factor</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Density links mass and volume: <code>\rho = m/V</code>.</li>
    <li>Use density to convert between mass and volume when doing mixture or solution problems later in the course.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Worked Example 4 – Using Density</h3>
  <p>A metal sample has mass 12.8 g and volume 4.00 mL. Calculate its density and comment on possible identity.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Compute density: <code>\rho = m/V = 12.8\,\text{g} / 4.00\,\text{mL} = 3.20\,\text{g mL}^{-1}</code>.</li>
    <li>Sig figs: 12.8 (three), 4.00 (three) → density has three sig figs (3.20 g·mL<sup>−1</sup>).</li>
    <li>Compare with tabulated densities (from your text or lab manual) to suggest a plausible metal.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>6. Common Pitfalls and Study Tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Always write units in every step; most mistakes are unit mistakes.</li>
    <li>Underline or circle the <em>given</em> and the <em>target</em> quantity before starting a calculation.</li>
    <li>Check whether your final answer makes sense (for example, size, sign, order of magnitude).</li>
    <li>Practice converting between °C and K, and between grams/milliliters and kilograms/liters, until it feels automatic.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Practice Problems (Self-Check)</h2>
  <p>Try these without looking at your notes, then compare with solutions in your textbook or with a tutor.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Classify each of the following as an element, compound, homogeneous mixture, or heterogeneous mixture: air, NaCl(s), brass, granite, blood.</li>
    <li>Identify each change as primarily physical or chemical: boiling water, burning paper, dissolving sugar, rusting iron, shredding paper.</li>
    <li>Convert 6.50 × 10<sup>2</sup> mg to grams and kilograms using dimensional analysis; show all unit‑cancellation steps.</li>
    <li>A student measures the mass of a liquid as 15.2 g and its volume as 12.3 mL. Calculate the density and express your answer with the correct significant figures.</li>
    <li>Room temperature is often approximated as 25.0 °C. Express this temperature in kelvin and in degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
    <li>A block of metal has dimensions 2.40 cm × 1.80 cm × 0.500 cm and mass 21.6 g. (a) Calculate its volume. (b) Determine its density. (c) Suggest a possible identity based on a density table.</li>
