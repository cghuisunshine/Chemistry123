    <h2>1.1 The Study of Chemistry</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Chemistry</strong> is the study of matter, its properties, and the changes it undergoes. It explains how a substance’s composition and structure control its observable features.</li>
      <li><strong>Matter</strong> is any physical material that has mass and occupies space; its <strong>properties</strong> are the characteristics we use to recognize and distinguish samples.</li>
      <li><strong>Elements</strong> are substances composed of only one kind of atom, while <strong>molecules</strong> are specific arrangements of two or more atoms bonded together.</li>
      <li><strong>Mixtures</strong> combine different substances without a fixed composition, so their properties vary with the relative amounts of each component.</li>
      <li>Chemists work in three realms: macroscopic observations, microscopic atoms/molecules, and symbolic representations such as chemical formulas.</li>
      <li>The <strong>scientific method</strong> progresses from observations to hypotheses, experiments, theories, and, eventually, scientific laws that summarize consistent behavior.</li>
      <li>Fundamental chemical work includes creating new materials, measuring their properties, and developing models to explain or predict their behavior.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <p>Section 1.1 focuses on concepts, definitions, and the scientific method rather than numerical formulas.</p>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">Ethanol and ethylene glycol are chemically similar on the surface, but ethanol contains one oxygen atom while ethylene glycol contains two. That subtle compositional/structural difference makes ethanol safe for drinks and ethylene glycol toxic, showing why chemists care about composition and arrangement.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="section" id="section-1-2">
    <h2>1.2 Classifications of Matter</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>States of matter</strong>: gases have no fixed shape or volume and are compressible; liquids have fixed volume and take the shape of their container; solids have both fixed shape and volume.</li>
      <li><strong>Pure substances</strong> maintain a constant composition. <strong>Elements</strong> contain one type of atom; <strong>compounds</strong> contain two or more elements in fixed ratios.</li>
      <li><strong>Mixtures</strong> have variable compositions. <strong>Homogeneous mixtures</strong> (solutions) are uniform, while <strong>heterogeneous mixtures</strong> show distinct regions.</li>
      <li>The <strong>law of constant composition</strong> (definite proportions) states that a pure compound always has the same elemental makeup regardless of the sample source.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <p>This section provides organizational rules (states, pure vs. mixtures) but no numerical formulas.</p>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">Sugar (sucrose) is a compound with a fixed ratio of C, H, and O atoms, brass is a homogeneous mixture (solid solution) of Cu and Zn, orange juice with pulp is a heterogeneous mixture, and oxygen gas (O<sub>2</sub>) is an element.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="section" id="section-1-3">
    <h2>1.3 Properties of Matter</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Physical properties</strong> describe observable traits without changing composition (color, melting point, density).</li>
      <li><strong>Chemical properties</strong> describe how a substance reacts or transforms into new substances.</li>
      <li><strong>Physical changes</strong> (melting, boiling, dissolving) preserve composition, whereas <strong>chemical changes</strong> (burning, rusting) form new substances.</li>
      <li><strong>Intensive properties</strong> (density, temperature) do not depend on sample size; <strong>extensive properties</strong> (mass, volume) scale with the amount of matter.</li>
      <li>Physical vs. chemical properties are used to separate and identify substances.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <p>No new equations appear here; instead focus on distinguishing physical vs. chemical behavior and identifying intensive/extensive clues.</p>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">Melting ice into water is a physical change because the composition stays H<sub>2</sub>O, while burning paper is a chemical change since new substances (ash, gas) form. Intensive properties like density help identify substances even when the amount changes.</p>

    <h2>1.4 The Nature of Energy</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Energy</strong> is the capacity to do work or transfer heat, and it exists as <strong>kinetic energy</strong> (motion) or <strong>potential energy</strong> (stored by position or bonds).</li>
      <li>Gain in temperature means molecules have gained kinetic energy, while chemical reactions exchange potential energy stored in bonds.</li>
      <li>Electrostatic potential energy between charges depends on their magnitudes and separation; creating bonds releases energy as more stable arrangements.</li>
      <li>Work and energy interconvert: moving a force through a distance changes the energy stored in or transferred by a system.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Work</strong> <code>w = F * d</code>
      <p>Work is the energy transferred when a force <em>F</em> (Newtons) moves an object through a displacement <em>d</em> (meters) in the same direction. The unit is joules (1 J = 1 N·m). If you push a cart with 50 N for 5 m, you do 250 J of work on it, the same amount of energy transferred from your muscles to the cart.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Kinetic energy</strong> <code>E<sub>k</sub> = ½ m v<sup>2</sup></code>
      <p>A moving object has kinetic energy proportional to its mass <em>m</em> (kg) and the square of its speed <em>v</em> (m/s). The unit is joules. A 2 kg mass moving at 3 m/s thus holds ½ · 2 · 3² = 9 J of energy—the faster or heavier it is, the more energy it carries.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">Propane combustion releases chemical potential energy as heat. Burning 9.0 kg of propane (46 kJ per gram) outputs about 4.1 × 10⁸ J, which is why such fuels can power grills or engines. Pumping an equivalent amount of energy into water (w = F·d) would require lifting roughly 5.6 × 10⁵ kg of water 75 m.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="section" id="section-1-5">
    <h2>1.5 Units of Measurement</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Scientific measurements always pair numbers with units, and chemistry relies on the metric (SI) system.</li>
      <li>SI base units include the meter (m) for length, kilogram (kg) for mass, kelvin (K) for temperature, second (s) for time, mole (mol) for amount, ampere (A) for current, and candela (cd) for luminous intensity.</li>
      <li>Prefixes (kilo-, centi-, milli-, micro-, nano-, etc.) scale units by powers of ten; e.g., 1 nm = 10⁻⁹ m.</li>
      <li>Derived units, such as speed (m/s) or volume (m³), arise from combining base units.</li>
      <li>Common volume units in chemistry include liters, where 1 L = 1 dm³ = 1000 cm³ = 1000 mL.</li>
      <li>Energy is measured in joules (1 J = 1 kg·m²/s²), with kilojoules and calories also used in chemistry and nutrition.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Celsius to Kelvin</strong> <code>K = °C + 273.15</code>
      <p>This formula converts a Celsius temperature into kelvins by adding 273.15. The kelvin has no degree symbol and shares the same sized increment as the Celsius degree, so 31 °C equals 304 K, which is the absolute scale used in SI calculations.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Density</strong> <code>density = mass ÷ volume</code>
      <p>Density relates how much mass (in grams or kilograms) fits inside a given volume (cubic centimeters, milliliters, etc.). Common units are g/cm³ or g/mL. For example, 100 g of mercury occupying 7.36 cm³ yields a density of 13.6 g/cm³, helping identify the substance.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">A forecast of 31 °C is 304 K, so chemists working in SI units record that temperature in kelvins. For density, 65.0 g of methanol at 0.791 g/mL occupies about 82.2 mL (mass ÷ density), which is vital when measuring liquids in volumetric glassware.</p>

  <section class="section" id="section-1-6">
    <h2>1.6 Uncertainty in Measurement</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Exact numbers</strong> have no uncertainty (counted objects or defined constants), while <strong>measured quantities</strong> always include some uncertainty from instruments and human reading.</li>
      <li><strong>Precision</strong> gauges how close repeated measurements are to one another; <strong>accuracy</strong> measures how close they are to the true value.</li>
      <li><strong>Significant figures</strong> list all certain digits plus one estimated digit; they represent the uncertainty in a measurement.</li>
      <li>Zeros between nonzero digits are significant, leading zeros are not, and trailing zeros are only significant if a decimal point or exponential notation is present.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Addition/subtraction rule</strong>
      <p>The result should be rounded to the same number of decimal places as the number with the fewest decimal places. For example, adding 20.42 (two decimals), 1.322 (three decimals), and 83.1 (one decimal) yields 104.842, which we round to 104.8 to keep one decimal place.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Multiplication/division rule</strong>
      <p>The final answer keeps the same number of significant figures as the least precise measurement. Multiplying 6.221 cm (four sig figs) by 5.2 cm (two sig figs) gives 32.3492 cm², so report 32 cm² to match the two significant figures.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">Determining gas density from container mass differences yields results with only three significant figures even though the individual masses had five. This happens because subtraction inherits the least precise decimal places and division inherits the least precise significant figures.</p>

  <section class="section" id="section-1-7">
    <h2>1.7 Dimensional Analysis</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Dimensional analysis treats units like algebra: multiply or divide with units and cancel them just as you do with numbers.</li>
      <li><strong>Conversion factors</strong> are ratios equating the same quantity in different units (e.g., 2.54 cm = 1 in); multiplying by them changes units while keeping the value the same.</li>
      <li>Unit tracking catches errors and guides the setup: if the final units do not match the desired ones, re-check the conversion chain.</li>
      <li>Complex conversions often use multiple steps—meters to centimeters to inches, or meters per second to miles per hour—by chaining conversion factors.</li>
      <li>Density can serve as a conversion factor between mass and volume when units differ.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>General conversion setup</strong>
      <p>The desired quantity equals the given quantity multiplied by one or more conversion factors whose numerators hold the desired units and whose denominators hold the given units. Each step cancels unwanted units, leaving the correct target unit while preserving the intrinsic value.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">To convert 115 lb to grams, multiply by 453.6 g/1 lb and cancel the pounds: 115 × 453.6 = 5.22 × 10⁴ g. To turn 8.00 m into inches, first use 100 cm/1 m, then 1 in/2.54 cm, giving 8.00 × (100 cm/1 m) × (1 in/2.54 cm) ≈ 315 in.</p>
