  <h1>Chapter 8: Basic Concepts of Chemical Bonding</h1>

  <section class="section" id="section-8-0">
    <h2>8.0 Overview — Basic Concepts of Chemical Bonding</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Valence electrons drive all bonding: electron transfer gives ionic solids, sharing gives covalent molecules, and delocalization gives metallic bonding.</li>
      <li>Lewis symbols expose which electrons sit in the outer shell, and the octet rule explains why many atoms aim for eight surrounding electrons.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Valence electrons</strong>
      <code>Valence electrons = group number (main-group)</code>
      <p>Counting valence electrons is always the first step before drawing Lewis symbols or structures; it is unaffected by where the electrons “come from.”</p>
    </div>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Octet goal</strong>
      <code>Octet = 8 electrons (full s + p)</code>
      <p>The octet rule represents the noble-gas configuration that atoms strive for through ionic or covalent bonding.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">Metals paired with nonmetals form ionic lattices; nonmetals sharing electrons form molecular covalent compounds. Recognizing which electrons participate is the first move.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="section-8-1">
    <h2>8.1 Lewis Symbols and the Octet Rule</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Lewis symbols place a dot for each valence electron around the element symbol so you can see how electron pairs might form.</li>
      <li>Most s- and p-block atoms reach stability by ending up with eight valence electrons; this is the octet rule.</li>
      <li>Main-group atoms usually have as many valence electrons as their group number; subtract 10 for p-block nonmetals to find the electrons outside the noble-gas core.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Valence electron count</strong>
      <code>Valence = group number (main-group); p-block: group number - 10</code>
      <p>This tells you how many dots to place when drawing Lewis symbols; e.g., Group 16 gives six dots because 16 - 10 = 6.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Octet guideline</strong>
      <code>Octet = 8 electrons (full s + p)</code>
      <p>An octet completes the valence s and p orbitals, which is why atoms often gain, lose, or share electrons to achieve this number.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">Sulfur (Group 16) uses six dots in its Lewis symbol; when it forms SO₂ it shares electron pairs until each atom reaches an octet.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="section-8-2">
    <h2>8.2 Ionic Bonding</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ionic bonds form when a metal donates electrons to a nonmetal, producing cations and anions that assemble into a lattice.</li>
      <li>Lattice energy captures the stabilization when gaseous ions come together and offsets the endothermic ionization steps.</li>
      <li>Born–Haber cycles sum atomization, ionization, electron affinity, and lattice formation to compute lattice energies.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Formation of NaCl</strong>
      <code>Na(s) + ½Cl₂(g) → NaCl(s) ΔHf° = -410.9 kJ/mol</code>
      <p>The strongly negative enthalpy reflects the large energy release when the ionic lattice forms.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Lattice energy</strong>
      <code>NaCl(s) → Na⁺(g) + Cl⁻(g) ΔHlattice = +788 kJ/mol</code>
      <p>Lattice energy is the energy needed to separate a solid into gaseous ions, so its magnitude equals the stabilization gained when the lattice forms.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Coulombic trend</strong>
      <code>E = k Q₁ Q₂ / d</code>
      <p>This shows the electrostatic energy increases with ionic charge magnitudes and decreases with distance, so CaO (2+ &amp; 2−) has a larger lattice energy than NaCl.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">Ordering CsI &lt; NaF &lt; CaO by lattice energy demonstrates how increased ionic charge and smaller radii raise the stabilization of the lattice.</p>

    <h2>8.3 Covalent Bonding</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Covalent bonds form when atoms share electron pairs; each shared pair contributes to the octet of both atoms (hydrogen only needs two electrons).</li>
      <li>Lewis structures show shared pairs as lines and lone pairs as dots, making it easy to track bonding.</li>
      <li>Group trends predict typical bonds: Group 17 elements usually bond once, Group 16 twice, Group 15 three times, and Group 14 four times.</li>
      <li>Higher bond order (more shared pairs) pulls atoms closer and strengthens the bond.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Bond order</strong>
      <code>Bond order = number of shared electron pairs</code>
      <p>A single bond (order 1) shares one pair; increasing to double or triple bonds raises the bond order, making the bond shorter and stronger.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">CO₂ features two C=O double bonds so each atom has an octet; N₂ has a triple bond (bond order 3) giving a short 110 pm length and inertness.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="section-8-4">
    <h2>8.4 Bond Polarity and Electronegativity</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Atoms differ in electronegativity, so shared electrons shift toward the more electronegative atom and create partial charges (δ⁻ on the stronger puller, δ⁺ on the other).</li>
      <li>Electronegativity generally increases across a period and decreases down a group; fluorine is the most electronegative element.</li>
      <li>Dipole moments (in Debye) quantify how much charge separation exists in a bond.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Electronegativity difference</strong>
      <code>Δχ = |χ_A - χ_B|</code>
      <p>Use Δχ to classify bonds: &lt;0.4 is nonpolar covalent, 0.4–2 polar covalent, and &gt;2 behaves mostly as ionic.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Dipole moment</strong>
      <code>μ = Q × r</code>
      <p>μ equals the separated charge Q times the distance r between them; a larger μ means greater polarity.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">HF has a large Δχ (~1.9) and strong dipole, HCl (Δχ ≈ 0.9) is moderately polar (μ ≈ 1.08 D), and LiF (Δχ &gt; 3) behaves like an ionic solid with virtually full charge separation.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="section-8-5">
    <h2>8.5 Drawing Lewis Structures</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Count total valence electrons (adjusting for charges), place atoms (central atom usually least electronegative), and connect them with single bonds.</li>
      <li>Complete octets on surrounding atoms, place remaining electrons on the center, and add multiple bonds if the central atom still lacks eight.</li>
      <li>Use formal charges to choose the best structure: the lowest absolute charges, with negative values on more electronegative atoms, dominate.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Total valence electrons</strong>
      <code>Total = Σ group numbers ± charge</code>
      <p>Add one electron per negative charge, subtract one per positive charge; later you will place these electrons in bonds and lone pairs.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Formal charge</strong>
      <code>FC = valence - (nonbonding + ½ bonding)</code>
      <p>FC estimates the charge on each atom; the structure with the least total FC magnitude and negative FC on electronegative atoms is best.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">COCl₂’s favored Lewis structure uses a C=O double bond and two C–Cl single bonds because this arrangement yields zero formal charge on every atom.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="section-8-6">
    <h2>8.6 Resonance Structures</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>When a molecule cannot be described by a single Lewis structure (e.g., because bonds are equivalent), draw all valid resonance structures.</li>
      <li>Atom connectivity must stay constant; only electron placements differ. The molecule is a resonance hybrid—an average of the contributors.</li>
      <li>Dominant contributors have smaller formal charges; equivalent structures contribute equally.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Resonance hybrid concept</strong>
      <code>Resonance hybrid ≈ average of dominant contributors</code>
      <p>The actual molecule reflects a weighted average of resonance forms, so measurable properties (bond length, energy) match the hybrid.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">Ozone has two resonance structures; both O–O bonds measure ≈127.8 pm. Benzene’s two Kekulé structures average to six identical C–C bonds of 140 pm and give aromatic stability.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="section-8-7">
    <h2>8.7 Exceptions to the Octet Rule</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Some species have an odd number of electrons (NO, ClO₂) so not every atom can have an octet.</li>
      <li>Electron-deficient molecules (BF₃, BeH₂) are stable with fewer than eight electrons around the central atom.</li>
      <li>Hypervalent species (PF₅, SF₆, ICl₄⁻) have more than eight electrons around a Period 3 or heavier atom because of their large size.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Exception check</strong>
      <code>Total valence = Σ group numbers ± charge</code>
      <p>If the total cannot give every atom eight electrons, the molecule may be electron-deficient or needs resonance/multiple bonds.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Hypervalent rule of thumb</strong>
      <code>Central atoms from Period 3 onward can comfortably hold &gt;8 electrons</code>
      <p>Large atoms can bond to more partners without extreme repulsion, which explains PF₅ and SF₆’s stability.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">BF₃ remains electron-deficient and accepts lone pairs; NO has an unpaired electron; PF₅ hosts ten electrons because phosphorus is large enough to accommodate five bonds.</p>
  </section>

    <h2>8.8 Strengths and Lengths of Covalent Bonds</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Average bond enthalpies measure the energy required to break a bond; higher bond order increases bond enthalpy.</li>
      <li>Bond length decreases as bond order increases (single &gt; double &gt; triple) because more shared pairs pull the atoms closer.</li>
      <li>Estimate reaction enthalpies by adding bond enthalpies for bonds broken and subtracting those formed.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Bond order trends</strong>
      <code>C−C: 154 pm, 348 kJ/mol; C=C: 134 pm, 614 kJ/mol; C≡C: 120 pm, 839 kJ/mol</code>
      <p>As bond order rises, length shrinks and strength grows. The pattern holds for many atom pairs.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Reaction enthalpy approximation</strong>
      <code>ΔH ≈ ΣD(bonds broken) − ΣD(bonds formed)</code>
      <p>Adding the energies for bonds you break and subtracting the energies of bonds you form gives a quick estimate for ΔH.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">Forming COCl₂ from CO and Cl₂ breaks a C≡O and a Cl–Cl bond while forming a C=O and two C–Cl bonds; using averaged D values yields ΔH ≈ −141 kJ/mol, so the reaction is exothermic.</p>
