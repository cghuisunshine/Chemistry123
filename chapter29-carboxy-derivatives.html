  <h1>Chapter 29: Carboxylic Acids and Their Derivatives</h1>

  <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
  <p>By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Recognize carboxylic acids and common derivatives (esters, amides, acid chlorides) from structures.</li>
    <li>Describe qualitatively why carboxylic acids are more acidic than simple alcohols.</li>
    <li>Relate derivative reactivity conceptually in terms of leaving‑group ability and resonance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Key Vocabulary</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Carboxylic acid</strong>: compound with –CO<sub>2</sub>H (–COOH) functional group.</li>
    <li><strong>Ester</strong>: derivative where the OH is replaced by OR′ (–CO<sub>2</sub>R).</li>
    <li><strong>Amide</strong>: derivative where OH is replaced by NR<sub>2</sub>.</li>
    <li><strong>Acid chloride</strong>: derivative with –COCl group.</li>
    <li><strong>Resonance</strong>: delocalization of electrons over more than one atom, stabilizing the structure.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>1. Structure and Acidity</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Carboxylic acids are more acidic than alcohols because their conjugate base (carboxylate) is resonance‑stabilized.</li>
    <li>Electron‑withdrawing substituents near the CO<sub>2</sub>H group generally increase acidity by stabilizing the conjugate base.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Derivative Reactivity (Conceptual)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Reactive hierarchy often summarized qualitatively: acid chloride &gt; anhydride &gt; ester ≈ carboxylic acid &gt; amide.</li>
    <li>More reactive species have better leaving groups attached to the carbonyl carbon (for example, Cl<sup>−</sup> is a better leaving group than OR<sup>−</sup>, which is better than NR<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Practice Problems (Self-Check)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Identify the functional group in each: CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H, CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>3</sub>CONH<sub>2</sub>, and CH<sub>3</sub>COCl.</li>
    <li>Explain in words why resonance makes carboxylic acids stronger acids than comparable alcohols.</li>
    <li>Given a simple structure, decide qualitatively whether it is likely to be more reactive (like an acid chloride) or less reactive (like an amide) toward nucleophilic acyl substitution.</li>
  </ol>
