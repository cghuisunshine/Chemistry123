  <h1>Chapter 7: Periodic Properties of the Elements</h1>
  <section class="section" id="section-7-1">
    <h2>7.1 Development of the Periodic Table</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>By 1869, chemists such as Mendeleev and Meyer noticed that arranging known elements by increasing atomic weight caused patterns in chemical and physical behavior to repeat periodically.</li>
      <li>Mendeleev left blank spaces for undiscovered elements and predicted specific properties for eka-elements (e.g., eka-silicon) so that each column grouped similar elements together.</li>
      <li>Moseley later tied the ordering to <strong>atomic number</strong>, the number of protons, which explains why elements such as Ar and K switch places compared to an atomic-weight sequence.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Modern periodic law</strong>
      <code>Elements ordered by increasing Z display repeating patterns in their properties.</code>
      <p>The atomic number Z is the count of protons, so arranging atoms by Z aligns families with the same electron configurations; the “periodicity” refers to the repeating rise and fall of properties such as reactivity, radii, and ionization energy.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Atomic number</strong>
      <code>Z = number of protons in the nucleus</code>
      <p>Protons carry a +1 charge, so Z also equals the positive charge that holds the electrons in place; it is a dimensionless integer that uniquely identifies each element.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">Mendeleev predicted an element below silicon (eka-silicon) with density ≈ 4.7 g/cm³ and oxide formulas XO₂ and XCl₄; when germanium was found, it matched his values closely. Ordering by Z also puts Ar (Z=18) among noble gases and K (Z=19) with the alkali metals, matching their observed chemistry.</p>

    <h2>7.2 Effective Nuclear Charge</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Each electron feels attraction from the positive nucleus and repulsion from the other electrons; repulsions act like a “screen” that weakens the pull.</li>
      <li>The <strong>effective nuclear charge</strong> Zeff is the net positive pull a valence electron actually experiences after accounting for screening.</li>
      <li>Zeff increases steadily across a period (more protons raise Z while shielding stays nearly constant) and rises only slightly down a group because extra shells add distance and additional screening.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Coulomb interaction (guiding idea)</strong>
      <code>E = k Q₁ Q₂ / d</code>
      <p>Energy E (in joules) is proportional to the product of charges Q₁ and Q₂ and inversely proportional to distance d between them; larger charge or shorter distance means a stronger attraction or repulsion, so electrons closer to a powerful nucleus bind more tightly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Effective nuclear charge</strong>
      <code>Z<sub>eff</sub> = Z − S</code>
      <p>Z is the actual nuclear charge (# of protons), and S is the shielding constant reflecting how much other electrons cancel the attraction. Both Z and S are dimensionless counts, so Zeff is also dimensionless. Core electrons screen almost fully (≈1.00 each), electrons in the same subshell screen partially (≈0.35 each), and electrons in the n−1 shell screen quite well (≈0.85 each) under Slater’s rules.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">In sodium, the 3s valence electron “sees” Z=11 and about S≈10 from the ten core electrons, so the simple Zeff estimate is 1. However, because the 3s orbital can spend some time near the core, the true S is closer to 8.5, giving Zeff≈2.5; this stronger pull explains why Na still binds its valence electron fairly tightly. Across a period (Na → Ar) cores stay the same while Z grows, so Zeff climbs and radii shrink.</p>
  </section>

    <h2>7.3 Sizes of Atoms and Ions</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The atomic radius is not a sharp edge; chemists define it by distances between nuclei: the bonding (covalent) radius is half a bond length, and the van der Waals radius is half the distance between nonbonded neighbors.</li>
      <li>Atomic radius increases down a group because electrons occupy higher principal quantum numbers (n) and decreases across a period because rising Zeff pulls valence electrons closer.</li>
      <li>Cations are smaller than their parent atoms (fewer electrons and stronger pull), and anions are larger (extra electrons push each other apart). Isoelectronic ions shrink as Z increases because the same electrons feel a stronger pull.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Bonding radius definition</strong>
      <code>r(atom) ≈ ½ × d(<em>A</em>–<em>A</em> bond)</code>
      <p>The distance d between two identical atoms forming a single bond is measured (often in picometers, pm); halving it gives an estimate of how close the electron cloud extends from the nucleus.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Isoelectronic radius trend</strong>
      <code>radius ∝ 1 / Z<sub>eff</sub> (for constant electron count)</code>
      <p>When atoms or ions share the same number of electrons, increasing the nuclear charge Z increases Zeff, squeezing electrons in tighter and reducing the radius even though the electron count stays fixed.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">Within Period 2, atomic radii shrink from N to O to F because more protons raise Zeff. In the isoelectronic series O²⁻, F⁻, Na⁺, Mg²⁺ (all 10 electrons), the radii drop as nuclear charge climbs from 8 to 12.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="section-7-4">
    <h2>7.4 Ionization Energy</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The first ionization energy is the energy needed to remove one electron from a gaseous atom; each successive ionization energy removes another electron from an ever-more-positively charged ion and therefore requires more energy.</li>
      <li>Ionization energy generally increases across a period (smaller radius and higher Zeff make electrons harder to remove) and decreases down a group as valence electrons are farther from the nucleus.</li>
      <li>Subshell structure causes anomalies: removing a 3p electron from Al is slightly easier than removing a 3s electron from Mg even though Al lies to the right of Mg.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>First ionization</strong>
      <code>X(g) → X⁺(g) + e⁻</code>
      <p>The energy required (IE₁, in kilojoules per mole) is always positive because work must be done to overcome the attraction between the electron and the nucleus; X(g) is the neutral atom, and e⁻ is the removed electron.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Successive ionization</strong>
      <code>X⁺(g) → X²⁺(g) + e⁻</code>
      <p>The second ionization energy IE₂ removes another electron from an already positive ion, so IE₂ &gt; IE₁. When IE jumps dramatically, it usually signals that the electron is being taken from a lower principal shell.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">Magnesium has a higher IE₁ than aluminum because Mg removes a 3s electron (closer to the nucleus), while Al removes a more energetic 3p electron; the 3s orbital is held tighter despite Mg being left of Al.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="section-7-5">
    <h2>7.5 Electron Affinity</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Electron affinity is the energy change when a gaseous atom accepts an electron; negative values mean energy is released, so the process is exothermic.</li>
      <li>Affinity generally becomes more negative across a period because higher Zeff makes atoms more eager to gain another electron; it gets less negative down a group as atoms get larger and add electron repulsion.</li>
      <li>Exceptions occur: Group 2 and noble gases have near-zero or positive affinities, and Group 15 atoms (like N) resist pairing electrons and therefore have less negative values.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Electron affinity process</strong>
      <code>X(g) + e⁻ → X⁻(g)</code>
      <p>EA (in kJ/mol) is the energy difference ΔE between the left and right sides. A negative EA means the atom releases energy when capturing an electron, while a positive EA means energy must be supplied.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">Chlorine releases about −349 kJ/mol when it gains an electron because completing its 3p⁵ shell is stabilizing. Sulfur gains an electron less easily than expected because the added electron must pair up in a 3p orbital, increasing repulsion, so its EA is not as negative.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="section-7-6">
    <h2>7.6 Metals, Nonmetals, and Metalloids</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Metals (left side) are shiny, conductive, and form cations easily because they have low ionization energies; nonmetals (right side) gain electrons, form anions or covalent bonds, and their oxides tend to be acidic.</li>
      <li>Metalloids sit along the diagonal and show mixed behavior; their bonding and conductivity place them between metals and nonmetals.</li>
      <li>Metallic character increases down a group (electrons are lost more readily), and decreases across a period as Zeff tightens hold on the electrons.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Metal oxide + water</strong>
      <code>M₂O(s) + H₂O(l) → 2MOH(aq)</code>
      <p>Alkali and alkaline earth oxides dissolve to give hydroxides (strong bases) because metal cations disperse into solution and release OH⁻ ions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Nonmetal oxide + water</strong>
      <code>SO₂(g) + H₂O(l) → H₂SO₃(aq)</code>
      <p>Nonmetal oxides usually dissolve to form acidic solutions; additional oxidation (SO₃ + H₂O → H₂SO₄) yields stronger acids.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">Sodium oxide dissolves to make NaOH, so sodium behaves as a metal with basic oxides. Sulfur dioxide forms sulfurous acid, illustrating how nonmetal oxides give acids.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="section-7-7">
    <h2>7.7 Trends for Group 1 and Group 2 Metals</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Group 1 (ns¹) and Group 2 (ns²) elements have low ionization energies and readily form M⁺ or M²⁺ ions to reach noble-gas configurations.</li>
      <li>Reactivity increases down each group because valence electrons sit in larger, more shielded orbitals.</li>
      <li>These metals react with water, halogens, and oxygen to form ionic compounds and release hydrogen, halide salts, or oxides.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Alkali metals + water</strong>
      <code>2M(s) + 2H₂O(l) → 2MOH(aq) + H₂(g)</code>
      <p>Each metal donates an electron to hydrogen, producing hydrogen gas and a soluble hydroxide.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Alkaline earth + water</strong>
      <code>M(s) + 2H₂O(l) → M(OH)₂(aq) + H₂(g)</code>
      <p>Group 2 metals behave similarly but deliver two positive charges, so they form hydroxides with M²⁺.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Metal + chlorine</strong>
      <code>2M(s) + Cl₂(g) → 2MCl(s)</code>
      <p>Halogens grab electrons easily, so the metals transfer electrons to form ionic chlorides (MCl₂ for alkaline earth metals uses the same idea with two electrons).</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">Cesium reacts more violently with water than lithium because its valence electron sits farther from the nucleus (lower IE), so Cs loses it faster and releases more heat and hydrogen.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="section-7-8">
    <h2>7.8 Trends for Selected Nonmetals</h2>
    <h3>Key ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Hydrogen has a 1s¹ configuration like alkali metals but usually behaves as a nonmetal, forming covalent bonds or serving as a proton (H⁺) when paired with very electronegative atoms.</li>
      <li>Group 16 (ns²np⁴) starts with strongly nonmetallic oxygen and shifts toward metalloid and metallic behavior (tellurium, polonium) as atoms grow larger and less electronegative.</li>
      <li>Nonmetal oxides and hydrides often form acids or share electrons to make covalent molecules.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Hydrogen chloride formation</strong>
      <code>H₂(g) + Cl₂(g) → 2HCl(g)</code>
      <p>The atoms share electrons in a polar covalent bond; the resulting molecule can dissolve in water.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Acid dissociation</strong>
      <code>HCl(g) → H⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq)</code>
      <p>In water, the bond polarizes so HCl releases a proton, behaving as a strong acid.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="formula">
      <strong>Sulfur oxides + water</strong>
      <code>SO₂(g) + H₂O(l) → H₂SO₃(aq)</code>
      <p>SO₂ forms sulfurous acid, while SO₃ + H₂O → H₂SO₄ gives sulfuric acid; heavier chalcogens follow similar patterns with less acidic oxides.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
    <p class="example">Sodium plus chlorine makes ionic NaCl, while hydrogen plus chlorine gives covalent HCl, showing hydrogen’s nonmetallic character. Burning sulfur in oxygen gives SO₂, which dissolves to form acids that contribute to acid rain.</p>
