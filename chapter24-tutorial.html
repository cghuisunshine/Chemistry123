    <section>
      <h2>24.1 General Characteristics of Organic Molecules</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Carbon forms four bonds (sp³, sp², sp) and creates the hydrocarbon skeleton; hydrogen sits on the periphery because it forms only one bond.</li>
        <li>Strong, nonpolar C–C and C–H bonds make hydrocarbons inert, so functional groups such as C–O or polar halides provide the reactive sites.</li>
        <li>Organic molecules mix an inert hydrocarbon framework with functional groups that define reactivity.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Alkane general formula:</strong> `CnH2n+2`. Every additional methylene (`–CH₂–`) adds two hydrogens while keeping the chain saturated.</li>
        <li><strong>Functional-group notation:</strong> `R–H` (alkanes) vs. `R–OH` (alcohols). The placeholder R represents the carbon skeleton, so the functional group (here –OH) controls reactivity.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) reacts through its polar O–H bond while the CH₃CH₂– portion remains unchanged, illustrating the functional group focus.</p>

      <h2>24.2 An Introduction to Hydrocarbons</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Hydrocarbons contain only carbon and hydrogen; the four classes are alkanes (single bonds), alkenes (double), alkynes (triple), and aromatic rings.</li>
        <li>Alkanes form a homologous series (`CnH2n+2`); each member differs from the next by one CH₂ unit, giving similar chemistry and steadily increasing boiling points.</li>
        <li>Dispersion forces grow with chain length, so light alkanes are gases, medium ones liquids (gasoline), and longer ones solids (waxes).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Alkane formula:</strong> `CnH2n+2`. For n = 1, CH₄; n = 5, C₅H₁₂; the series extends indefinitely with predictable increases in molecular weight and physical properties.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Pentane (C₅H₁₂) is a liquid with a boiling point near 36 °C and is a component of gasoline.</p>

      <h2>24.3 Structures of Alkanes</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Carbons in alkanes are sp³ hybridized and tetrahedral (109.5°), forming sigma bonds by head-on overlap of hybrid orbitals.</li>
        <li>Straight-chain alkanes (n-alkanes) have constitutional isomers when the carbon backbone branches.</li>
        <li>Rotation about C–C single bonds gives conformational isomers, with staggered arrangements lower in energy than eclipsed ones.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Conformational energy:</strong> Staggered < eclipsed because torsional strain arises when adjacent bonds align; molecules adopt staggered conformations to minimize energy.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Cyclohexane prefers the chair conformer over the boat by ~30 kJ/mol because it minimizes steric and torsional strain.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>24.4 Alkane Nomenclature</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Name alkanes by finding the longest chain, numbering it to give substituents the lowest locants, and listing substituents alphabetically with prefixes (di-, tri-).</li>
        <li>Alkyl substituents replace the `-ane` ending with `-yl` (methyl, ethyl, propyl, etc.).</li>
        <li>For multiple identical substituents use `di-`, `tri-`, `tetra-` etc., and separate location numbers with commas.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Naming formula:</strong> `number-ligand + parent alkane`. E.g., `3,4-dimethylheptane` indicates two methyls on carbons 3 and 4 of a seven-carbon chain.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>3-ethyl-2-methylpentane is drawn by adding an ethyl at C3 and a methyl at C2 to the pentane backbone (`CH₃CH(CH₃)CH(CH₂CH₃)CH₂CH₃`).</p>

      <h2>24.5 Cycloalkanes</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Cycloalkanes are rings of carbons with formula `CnH2n` and arise when an alkane chain closes; short rings (<5) suffer angle strain.</li>
        <li>Cyclohexane uses chair and boat conformations to approach 109.5° angles; the chair form is more stable because it avoids eclipsing and nonbonded interactions.</li>
        <li>Substituents prefer equatorial positions to reduce 1,3-diaxial interactions (e.g., methylcyclohexane favors the equatorial methyl group).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cycloalkane formula:</strong> `CnH2n`. Closing the chain removes two hydrogens compared to the corresponding open-chain alkane.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>In cyclohexane, the axial methyl experiences repulsion from axial hydrogens on the same face (1,3-diaxial), so the equatorial conformer is more stable.</p>

      <h2>24.6 Organic Functional Groups</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Functional groups are reactive atoms/groups (e.g., –OH, –NH₂, C=O, halides) that define how organic molecules behave.</li>
        <li>Many functional groups contain heteroatoms such as O and N; functional group chemistries are similar across different molecules once the group is present.</li>
        <li>The alkyl symbol R represents the carbon framework when discussing reactions focused on the functional group (e.g., R–OH for alcohols).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Functional shorthand:</strong> `R–OH` (alcohol), `R–CHO` (aldehyde), `R–COOH` (carboxylic acid), etc.; the functionality dictates reactions while R stabilizes the molecule.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Morphine, heroin, methadone, and naloxone all share key functional groups (alcohol, amine, ester) that influence solubility and receptor binding.</p>

      <h2>24.7 Reactions of Alkanes</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Alkanes resist most reagents due to strong C–C and C–H bonds, but they combust with oxygen and undergo radical halogenation when exposed to heat or light.</li>
        <li>Chain radical halogenation follows initiation (Cl₂ → 2 Cl·), propagation (Cl· abstracts H → R·; R· reacts with Cl₂ → RCl + Cl·), and termination (radicals recombine) steps.</li>
        <li>Secondary and tertiary hydrogens are more easily abstracted than primary ones because the resulting radicals are more stable (selectivity ~1°:2°:3° = 1:4:5 for Cl, 1:100:1500 for Br).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Combustion:</strong> `CnH2n+2 + (3n+1)/2 O₂ → n CO₂ + (n+1) H₂O`. Example: `2 C₂H₆ + 7 O₂ → 4 CO₂ + 6 H₂O` releases ~2855 kJ.</li>
        <li><strong>Radical selectivity:</strong> `1°:2°:3° ≈ 1:4:5` for Cl and `1:100:1500` for highly selective Br due to differences in C–H bond energies and radical stabilization.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Propane chlorination yields 1-chloropropane and 2-chloropropane; tertiary hydrogens would give even higher preference in bromination because tertiary radicals are most stabilized.</p>
