    <section>
      <h2>29.1 Carboxylic Acids</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The carboxyl group (COOH) merges a carbonyl and hydroxyl attached to an sp2 carbon, giving both resonance-stabilized conjugate bases and strong hydrogen bonding at the OH that raises boiling points and water solubility for small acids.</li>
        <li>The acidity of RCOOH (pKa ~4-5 for acetic acid) stems from the stable carboxylate anion; resonance over two equivalent O atoms spreads negative charge, making the conjugate base far less reactive than the alkoxide from the corresponding alcohol (pKa ~16).</li>
        <li>Inductive effects tune acidity: electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., Cl) near the COOH weaken the O-H bond (lowering pKa), and reacting with bases or amines makes soluble salts that aid drug delivery or formulation.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Acid dissociation:</strong> <code>RCOOH + H2O -> RCOO- + H3O+</code> (Equation 29.1). The carboxyl carbon pulls electron density toward both oxygens; when the O-H bond breaks, the negative charge spreads over both O atoms, which is why carboxylic acids are weak acids whose pKa values sit near 4-5.</li>
        <li><strong>Carboxylate resonance:</strong> <code>[R-C(=O)-O-] <-> [R-CO(-1)-O=]</code>. This resonance explains why the conjugate base is stabilized and why molecules like acetic acid are much stronger acids than ethanol.</li>
        <li><strong>Base neutralization:</strong> <code>RCOOH + NaOH -> RCOONa + H2O</code> (Equation 29.2). Salt formation increases aqueous solubility, so pharmaceuticals are often delivered as carboxylate or ammonium salts (for example, acetate + ethylamine -> ethylammonium acetate, Equation 29.4).</li>
        <li><strong>Bicarbonate reaction:</strong> <code>RCOOH + NaHCO3 -> RCOONa + CO2 + H2O</code> (Equation 29.3). The evolution of CO2 is a convenient test for acids (e.g., in effervescent tablets) and shows carbonate salts release gas when acidified.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Acetic acid (CH3COOH) dissolves in water and donates a proton to water to make acetate; adding NaOH gives sodium acetate, which is more soluble and used in buffers.</li>
        <li>Mixing acetic acid with ethanol in the presence of acid makes ethyl acetate (Fischer esterification, Section 29.3) while reacting with NaHCO3 effervesces CO2, illustrating acidity and salt behavior.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>29.2 Preparation of Carboxylic Acids</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Oxidizing primary alcohols (or aldehydes) with strong oxidants (K2Cr2O7/H2SO4, KMnO4) converts them to carboxylic acids; aldehydes that form along the way are quickly over-oxidized, so stopping at the acid requires careful control.</li>
        <li>Industrial acetic acid comes from carbonylation of methanol (<code>CH3OH + CO -> CH3COOH</code>, Equation 29.5) with a rhodium catalyst, while benzoic acid forms by oxidizing toluene or via phenylmagnesium bromide plus CO2.</li>
        <li>Functional-group interconversion routes (hydrolyzing esters, amides, nitriles) and Grignard addition to dry ice are reliable ways to extend carbon chains to acids.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Alcohol oxidation:</strong> <code>RCH2OH + [O] -> RCOOH + H2O</code>. Strong oxidizing agents attack the primary carbon, eventually forming the carboxyl group; this is why ethanol exposed to air or acid turns into acetic acid (vinegar).</li>
        <li><strong>Carbonylation:</strong> <code>CH3OH + CO -> CH3COOH</code> (Equation 29.5). The CO inserts between the methyl and hydroxyl; the process is highly efficient for making acetic acid at scale.</li>
        <li><strong>Grignard + CO2:</strong> <code>R-MgX + CO2 -> RCOO-MgX -> H3O+ -> RCOOH</code> (Equation 29.10). Carbon dioxide acts as an electrophile, so nucleophilic carbanions add to it, and protonation delivers the carboxylic acid with one extra carbon.</li>
        <li><strong>Hydrolysis sources:</strong> esters, amides and nitriles hydrolyze under acidic or basic conditions (Equations 29.11–29.13) to regenerate RCOOH, which chemists use to cleave protecting groups or produce acids from simpler precursors.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Oxidation of pentan-1-ol with acidic dichromate produces pentanoic acid, giving a longer-chain acid starting from the alcohol (Equation 29.6).</li>
        <li>Treating 1-bromobutane with Mg/ether, then CO2, and finally acid yields pentanoic acid (Sample Exercise 29.2), showing how Grignard chemistry extends carbon chains.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>29.3 Esters and Esterification</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Esters <code>RCOOR'</code> form when a carboxylic acid condenses with an alcohol under acid catalysis (Fischer esterification); the alcohol portion gives the “alkyl” name and the acid the “-oate” suffix.</li>
        <li>The reaction is reversible; adding water or using dilute acid shifts equilibrium back to acids and alcohols, making esters useful as temporary protecting groups.</li>
        <li>Basic hydrolysis (saponification) cleaves esters to carboxylate salts and alcohols, underpinning soap manufacture and flavor chemistry.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Esterification:</strong> <code>RCOOH + R'OH <-> RCOOR' + H2O</code> (Equation 29.14). The acid catalyst protonates the carbonyl, allowing the alcohol to attack; removing water or using excess alcohol drives the equilibrium to ester formation.</li>
        <li><strong>Acidic hydrolysis:</strong> <code>RCOOR' + H2O -> RCOOH + R'OH</code>. Reintroducing water shifts the equilibrium back, regenerating the acid and alcohol; this reversibility is the basis for protecting carboxyl groups.</li>
        <li><strong>Saponification (base hydrolysis):</strong> <code>RCOOR' + OH- -> RCOO- + R'OH</code> (Equation 29.16). The base produces a soluble carboxylate salt, and upon acidification the free acid returns; soaps exploit the amphiphilic salt to emulsify grease.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Ethyl acetate forms from acetic acid and ethanol, giving a sweet-smelling ester used in nail polish remover (Figure 29.5 and Equation 29.14).</li>
        <li>Saponifying methyl propionate with NaOH yields sodium propionate and methanol (Equation 29.16), a reaction analogous to how soap producers cleave fats.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>29.4 Fats, Oils, and Waxes</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Lipids encompass hydrophobic esters such as waxes (fatty acid + long alcohol) and triglycerides (glycerol + three fatty acids); their nonpolar alkyl chains dominate their solubility and melting behavior.</li>
        <li>Saturated fatty acids pack tightly and give solid fats (e.g., stearic acid); unsaturated chains introduce kinks, lower melting points (oils), and allow hydrogenation (hardening) to make margarines.</li>
        <li>Saponification of triglycerides with strong base creates soap (carboxylate salts), and detergents replace carboxylate heads with sulfonate groups to avoid scum formation in hard water.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Triglyceride formation:</strong> <code>glycerol + 3 RCOOH -> glycerol triester + 3 H2O</code>. Each ester link removes water, building a triester whose long chains give the characteristic lipid texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Saponification:</strong> <code>triglyceride + 3 NaOH -> glycerol + 3 RCOONa</code> (Equation 29.17). The carboxylate salts act as soaps—micelles form with hydrophobic tails inside and hydrophilic heads outside to emulsify oils (Figure 29.8).</li>
        <li><strong>Hydrogenation (hardening):</strong> <code>C=C + H2 -> C-C</code> across the unsaturated fatty chains. Partial hydrogenation increases saturation, raising melting points to turn oils into fats while controlling trans isomer formation.</li>
        <li><strong>Soap scum formation:</strong> <code>2 RCOO- + Ca2+ -> (RCOO)2Ca</code> (Equation 29.18); detergents avoid that by using sulfonate heads whose calcium salts remain soluble.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Vegetable oils (rich in oleic/linoleic acids) are hydrogenated to margarine by adding hydrogen across double bonds, making the triglyceride solid at room temperature.</li>
        <li>Classic soap-making boils animal fat with NaOH: the triglyceride saponifies to glycerol plus sodium stearate, which forms micelles to clean greasy grime.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>29.5 Acid Chlorides, Anhydrides, and Nucleophilic Acyl Substitution</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Reactive acyl derivatives (acid chlorides and anhydrides) form from carboxylic acids (e.g., <code>RCOOH + SOCl2 -> RCOCl + SO2 + HCl</code>) and allow selective transformation without affecting other functional groups, a strategy used for protecting groups in complex synthesis.</li>
        <li>Nucleophilic acyl substitution occurs when Nu- adds to the carbonyl of <code>RCOY</code> (Y = Cl, OR, OCOR), forming a tetrahedral intermediate that collapses to expel Y- and give esters, amides, or acids depending on the nucleophile.</li>
        <li>Esters react further with strong nucleophiles (e.g., Grignard reagents or hydride) because the intermediate regenerates an electrophilic ketone, so two equivalents are used to reach stable tertiary or primary alcohols.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Acid chloride formation:</strong> <code>RCOOH + SOCl2 -> RCOCl + SO2 + HCl</code> (Equation 29.20). Thionyl chloride replaces the hydroxyl with Cl, making a much more electrophilic acyl halide useful for downstream substitutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Nucleophilic acyl substitution:</strong> <code>RCOY + Nu- -> RCONu + Y-</code> (Equation 29.23). The tetrahedral intermediate ejects Y- (a good leaving group) and regenerates a carbonyl with the new nucleophile attached, enabling conversions to amides, esters, anhydrides, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Grignard addition to esters:</strong> <code>RCOOR' + 2 RMgX -> tertiary alkoxide -> H3O+ -> tertiary alcohol</code> (Equations 29.24–29.25). The first equivalent makes a ketone, which reacts again because it is reactive, so two equivalents are required to avoid mixtures.</li>
        <li><strong>Hydride reduction:</strong> <code>RCOOR' + LiAlH4 -> RCH2OH</code> (via aldehyde intermediate, Equations 29.26–29.27). Controlled hydride delivery yields primary alcohols; esters act as precursors to both aldehydes and alcohols.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Butanoic acid treated with SOCl2 gives butanoyl chloride, which then reacts with ethanol to form ethyl butanoate without affecting other groups (Equations 29.20 and 29.21).</li>
        <li>Adding excess phenylmagnesium bromide to ethyl benzoate yields a tertiary alcohol after acidic workup (Sample Exercise 29.3), showing how nucleophilic acyl substitution follows through to alcohols.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>29.6 Condensation Polymerization</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Condensation (step-growth) polymerization links difunctional monomers, one bond at a time, releasing small molecules (e.g., water); polyesters come from diacids/diols and polyamides from diacids/diamines.</li>
        <li>PET (polyethylene terephthalate, Dacron) is a polyester widely used in textiles and medical devices; nylon 6,6 arises from adipic acid and hexamethylenediamine, while nylon 6 derives from caprolactam ring opening and condensation.</li>
        <li>Copolymers alternate monomers (A-B-A-B) for nylon 6,6, whereas nylon 6 has repeating single monomer units (A-A-A) from the same monomer.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Polyester formation:</strong> <code>n dimethyl terephthalate + n ethylene glycol -> PET + 2n H2O</code> (Equation 29.28). Ester links connect repeating units, and removing water drives the polymerization.</li>
        <li><strong>Polyamide formation (nylon 6,6):</strong> <code>n hexamethylenediamine + n adipic acid -> nylon 6,6 + 2n H2O</code> (Equation 29.29). Amide bonds (CONH) join the chains, giving strong, heat-resistant fibers.</li>
        <li><strong>Ring-opening (nylon 6):</strong> <code>e-caprolactam + heat + H2O -> nylon 6</code>. One monomer repeatedly forms amide linkages; the single-digit designation (6) reflects the six-carbon monomer.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Dacron (PET) fibers for heart-valve rings arise from ethylene glycol and dimethyl terephthalate heated to condense water (Equation 29.28), showcasing the biocompatibility of polar oxygen linkages.</li>
        <li>Nylon 6,6 is formed from adipic acid and hexamethylene diamine (Equation 29.29), giving the 6,6 naming and providing materials for apparel, carpets, and ropes.</li>
