# Chapter 31 Tutorial — Nitrogen-Containing Organic Compounds

## 31.1 Amines and the Amide Bond

### Key ideas
- Amines (RNH2, R2NH, R3N) are organic bases that resemble ammonia; aliphatic amines have alkyl groups while aromatic amines (e.g., aniline) attach a phenyl ring to nitrogen, and cyclic versions include heterocycles like pyridine.
- Amines soak up protons to form ammonium ions, and their basicity (pKa ~9–10 for aliphatic amines) is governed by the availability of the lone pair on nitrogen and nearby electron-donating/withdrawing groups.
- Amides result from condensing an amine with a carboxylic acid or its derivatives; the amide bond is planar and has partial double-bond character, leading to cis/trans restriction and resonance stabilization that locks the backbone of peptides.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Amine protonation:** `R3N + H+ -> R3NH+`. The nitrogen lone pair accepts a proton, so stronger bases (higher pKa of conjugate acid) hold onto that proton more tightly; this explains why tertiary amines are still basic yet less available than primary ones due to sterics.
- **Amide formation:** `RCOOH + R'NH2 -> RCONHR' + H2O` (or via acid chlorides/anhydrides). This condensation links amino and carboxyl groups; resonance between the lone pair on nitrogen and the carbonyl makes the C–N bond shorter and the nitrogen planar.
- **Amide geometry:** The carbonyl and nitrogen atoms adopt ~120° angles and stay coplanar because of delocalized electrons; rotation about the C–N bond is restricted, so peptides display stable cis/trans conformations that define protein backbones.

### Short example(s)
- Ethylamine reacts with acetic acid to give ethylammonium acetate; treating the conjugate base with NaOH recovers the amine, demonstrating the reversible acid-base nature of amines.
- Acetyl chloride (an acid chloride) plus ethanamine yields N-ethylacetamide; the resonance-stabilized amide bond restricts rotation, so model peptides use one conformation to build larger chains.

## 31.2 Amino Acids

### Key ideas
- α-Amino acids contain both an amino group and a carboxyl group on the same carbon, making them amphiprotic; in water they form zwitterions (NH3+ and COO−) whose distribution depends on pH.
- Each amino acid has two pKa values (pKa1 ≈ 2 for the COOH, pKa2 ≈ 9.5 for the NH3+), and the isoelectric point `pI = (pKa1 + pKa2)/2` is the pH where the net charge is zero.
- Side chains tune behavior: acidic residues have extra COOH groups (giving a third pKa), basic residues add extra NH2/NH3+ heads, and polar versus nonpolar side chains influence solubility and folding.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Zwitterion equilibria:** `H3N+CH(R)COOH ⇄ H3N+CH(R)COO- + H+` (pKa1) and `H3N+CH(R)COOH ⇄ H2NCH(R)COO- + H+` (pKa2). Each equilibrium shows how proton transfers convert between charged species; pKa values help predict predominant forms at given pH.
- **Isoelectric point:** `pI = (pKa1 + pKa2)/2`. This midpoint of the titration curve is where the positive and negative charges cancel, so proteins have minimal solubility near their pI.
- **Henderson-Hasselbalch form:** `pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid])` applied separately to both carboxyl and amino sites allows calculation of species ratios at biological pH.

### Short example(s)
- Glycine (pKa1 = 2.35, pKa2 = 9.60) is neutral at pH ≈ 5.98 (its pI); below that it carries a net positive charge, and above it carries a net negative charge, which is essential for protein purification.
- Serine has a polar hydroxymethyl side chain, so above its pKa2 it exists mainly as `NH2CH(CH2OH)COO-`, which explains why serine residues often participate in hydrogen bonds within enzymes.

## 31.3 Proteins, Peptides, and Enzymes

### Key ideas
- Peptides form by linking amino acids via peptide (amide) bonds between the carboxyl of one residue and the amino of the next; the resulting backbone is planar and trans-favored, allowing organized secondary structures.
- Proteins are long polypeptides whose primary structure (sequence) is specified by mRNA codons; folding into α-helices and β-sheets relies on backbone hydrogen bonding, while tertiary/ quaternary structure depends on side-chain interactions and disulfide bridges.
- Enzymes are proteins whose active site arranges amino acids to accelerate biochemical reactions, often by stabilizing transition states and binding substrates with high specificity.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Peptide bond formation:** `H2N-CH(R1)-COOH + H2N-CH(R2)-COOH -> H2N-CH(R1)-CONH-CH(R2)-COOH + H2O`. Condensation removes water and creates a rigid `–CONH–` linkage; repeating this builds polypeptides.
- **Protein structure hierarchy:** Primary = sequence; secondary = α-helix/β-sheet via backbone H-bonds; tertiary = side-chain packing; quaternary = multiple polypeptide units. Understanding these levels shows how sequence controls function.
- **Peptide sequencing:** Chemical methods such as Edman degradation sequentially remove N-terminal residues; knowing the sequence lets you trace mRNA codons and identify unknown proteins.

### Short example(s)
- Glycylalanine (Gly-Ala) is a dipeptide formed by linking glycine and alanine; hydrolyzing it regenerates the two amino acids, analogous to how digestive enzymes cleave dietary proteins.
- The primary structure of hemoglobin dictates its α-helices and heme-binding pockets, illustrating how sequence changes (mutations) can alter folding and oxygen transport.

## 31.4 Nucleic Acids and DNA

### Key ideas
- Nucleic acids (DNA, RNA) store genetic information; monomers are nucleotides composed of a five-carbon sugar (deoxyribose or ribose), a nitrogenous base (purines A/G or pyrimidines C/T/U), and a phosphate group.
- DNA strands pair via Watson-Crick base pairing (A–T with two H-bonds, G–C with three H-bonds) to form an antiparallel double helix whose sugar-phosphate backbone runs outside and bases stack inside.
- RNA differs by having ribose, uracil instead of thymine, and typically being single-stranded, but both nucleic acids link nucleotides through phosphodiester bonds (3′–5′ linkages).

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Nucleotide structure:** `nucleoside + phosphate -> nucleotide`. The phosphate attaches to the 5′ carbon, enabling polymerization via phosphate ester linkages; attaching more phosphates (ATP) stores chemical energy for biosynthesis.
- **Base pairing rule:** `<code>A pairs with T (or U in RNA) via 2 H-bonds; G pairs with C via 3 H-bonds</code>`. This complementarity keeps the DNA double helix stable and allows accurate replication/transcription.
- **Phosphodiester link:** `5′-OH of one sugar + phosphate + 3′-OH of next sugar -> 3′-5′ phosphodiester`. These covalent bonds along the backbone maintain the strand integrity and define directionality for enzymes.

### Short example(s)
- Watson and Crick’s model has two antiparallel DNA strands held by base pairs, so a single-strand sequence 5′-AGT-3′ pairs with 3′-TCA-5′, enabling replication templates.
- ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is a nucleotide with three phosphates; hydrolyzing the terminal phosphate powers enzyme-catalyzed reactions that build polypeptides and nucleic acids.
