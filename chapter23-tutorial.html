    <section>
      <h2>23.1 The Transition Metals</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Partially filled d orbitals give transition metals variable oxidation states, colorful salts, and catalytic behavior.</li>
        <li>Period 5 and 6 transition metals mirror one another because of the lanthanide contraction.</li>
        <li>Paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, and antiferromagnetic behaviors depend on how unpaired d-electron spins align; above T<sub>C</sub> or T<sub>N</sub> they become paramagnetic.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Magnetism and unpaired electrons:</strong> Fewer unpaired d electrons produce diamagnetism while more lead to paramagnetism, so measuring magnetism reveals the number of unpaired electrons and thus the metal’s electron configuration.</li>
        <li><strong>Ordering temperatures:</strong> T<sub>C</sub> (ferro/ferrimagnetic) and T<sub>N</sub> (antiferromagnetic) are the thresholds where magnetic order collapses because thermal energy overcomes spin alignment.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Iron, cobalt, and nickel are the only pure transition metals that are ferromagnetic at room temperature, so they can be magnetized strongly until the Curie temperature is exceeded.</p>

      <h2>23.2 Transition-Metal Complexes</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Coordination compounds contain a metal ion surrounded by ligands (Lewis bases) that donate electron pairs.</li>
        <li>Coordination numbers (often 4 or 6) dictate tetrahedral, square-planar, or octahedral geometries.</li>
        <li>Complex formation alters color and redox behavior because coordinating ligands stabilize particular oxidation states.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Complex charge:</strong> `q_complex = q_metal + Σ q_ligand`. In [Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺ the neutral ammines leave Cu’s +2 charge as the complex charge.</li>
        <li><strong>Formation constant:</strong> `K_f = [complex]/([metal][ligand]^n)`. The much larger K_f for Ni(en)₃²⁺ versus Ni(NH₃)₆²⁺ arises from the chelate effect—chelation releases more solvent and binds tighter.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>[Rh(NH₃)₅Cl](NO₃)₂ contains Rh³⁺ because the neutral ammines add no charge, the coordinated chloride is −1, and the two nitrate counterions contribute −2, so the cation must be 2⁺ to balance.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>23.3 Common Ligands in Coordination Chemistry</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Ligands bond via donor atoms; monodentate ligands donate one pair while bidentate/polydentate (chelating) ligands donate multiple pairs simultaneously.</li>
        <li>The chelate effect stabilizes metal complexes much more than similar monodentate ligands because entropy increases when fewer chelate ligands form multiple bonds.</li>
        <li>Natural chelates such as porphyrins hold Fe(II) in hemoglobin and Mg(II) in chlorophyll, enabling oxygen transport and photosynthesis.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Chelate effect data:</strong> K_f(Ni(en)₃²⁺) ≈ 6.8 × 10¹⁷ vs. K_f(Ni(NH₃)₆²⁺) ≈ 1.2 × 10⁹ shows that chelating ethylenediamine forms an enormously more stable complex than six ammines.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Na₂Ca(EDTA) treats lead poisoning because the EDTA chelate is strong enough to solubilize Pb²⁺ so it can be excreted.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>23.4 Nomenclature and Isomerism in Coordination Chemistry</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Names list ligands alphabetically, the metal with its oxidation state, and add `-ate` for anionic complexes, e.g., potassium hexacyanidoferrate(II).</li>
        <li>Constitutional isomers include linkage isomers (NO₂⁻ vs. ONO⁻) and coordination-sphere isomers where different species occupy the inner sphere.</li>
        <li>Stereoisomers—geometric (cis/trans) and optical (enantiomers)—have the same bonds but different spatial arrangements with different physical and biological consequences.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Naming rule:</strong> `ligands → metal (oxidation state) → counterions`. Example: [Co(NH₃)₅Cl]Cl₂ is pentaamminechloridocobalt(III) chloride; the Cl⁻ anion is named last.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>cis-[Pt(NH₃)₂Cl₂] (cisplatin) is an effective anticancer drug because the cis arrangement lets platinum chelate adjacent DNA nitrogens, whereas trans-[Pt(NH₃)₂Cl₂] cannot.</p>

      <h2>23.5 Color and Magnetism in Coordination Chemistry</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The observed color is the complement of the absorbed wavelength; absorption spectra reveal which visible photons excite d electrons.</li>
        <li>The number of unpaired d electrons determines whether a complex is paramagnetic or diamagnetic.</li>
        <li>Changing ligands alters the d-orbital splitting and so shifts both color (λ_max) and magnetism.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Photon energy:</strong> `E = hc/λ`. Absorption at 680 nm (red) means the complex appears green because blue/green light is transmitted.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>trans-[Co(NH₃)₄Cl₂]²⁺ absorbs red light (~680 nm) so it looks green, while the cis isomer absorbs yellow light and appears violet—different geometries give different spectra.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>23.6 Crystal-Field Theory</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Ligand fields split the metal d orbitals (t₂ and e for octahedral, reversed for tetrahedral) because some orbitals point toward ligands and experience stronger repulsion.</li>
        <li>Δ (crystal-field splitting energy) competes with spin-pairing energy; when Δ &gt; pairing energy a low-spin configuration results, while Δ &lt; pairing energy gives high-spin.</li>
        <li>The spectrochemical series orders ligands by increasing Δ (Cl⁻ &lt; H₂O &lt; NH₃ &lt; en &lt; CN⁻), so replacing water with cyanide shortens the absorption λ_max and often converts a paramagnetic complex to a diamagnetic one.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Spin pairing vs. Δ:</strong> When Δ &gt; spin-pairing energy, electrons pair in t₂ orbitals → low-spin (e.g., [Co(CN)₆]³⁻); when Δ &lt; pairing energy, they remain unpaired in the e orbitals → high-spin (e.g., [CoF₆]³⁻).</li>
        <li><strong>Δ from spectroscopy:</strong> `Δ = hc/λ_max`. Ti(H₂O)₆³⁺ absorbs 500 nm light, so its Δ matches that photon energy, explaining its purple color.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>[Ni(CN)₄]²⁻ is square planar and diamagnetic because CN⁻ is strong-field, while tetrahedral [NiCl₄]²⁻ is paramagnetic with two unpaired electrons due to weak-field chlorides.</p>
