    <h1>Chapter 30 Tutorial — Benzene and Its Derivatives</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>30.1 The Structure of Benzene</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Each carbon in benzene is sp2 hybridized, forming six C-C sigma bonds and six C-H sigma bonds in the plane while leaving one perpendicular 2p orbital per carbon to host the pi electrons.</li>
        <li>The six unhybridized 2p orbitals overlap to make a continuous pi-cloud; drawing two Kekule structures and the circled hexagon emphasizes that the pi-electrons are delocalized over the ring.</li>
        <li>Benzene resists reactions that would break its aromaticity (addition) and instead prefers substitutions that retain the delocalized pi-system.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>pi-electron count:</strong> Each carbon contributes one electron to the pi system (<code>6 pi-electrons = 4n + 2</code> with n = 1), showing that benzene satisfies Huckel's rule for aromaticity and is unusually stable.</li>
        <li><strong>Bond uniformity:</strong> The C-C bond length in benzene (~139 pm) is intermediate between single and double bonds, so students can infer that all six bonds share the same strength because the pi-electrons are spread evenly.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The circle-in-a-hexagon drawing replaces alternating double bonds in benzene to stress delocalization, unlike cyclohexene where the double bond is localized and reacts readily with bromine.</li>
        <li>Hydrogenation of benzene does not proceed like three separate alkene additions, which would release ~348 kJ/mol, but instead only releases −208 kJ/mol, pointing to the extra stability of the aromatic ring.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>30.2 Isomerism and Nomenclature in Aromatic Compounds</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Benzene derivatives are named either with the benzene ring as the parent (e.g., nitrobenzene) or as a substituent phenyl/benzyl group attached to another functional group (e.g., phenylamine or benzyl chloride).</li>
        <li>Disubstituted benzenes are labeled ortho (1,2-), meta (1,3-), or para (1,4-) when two positions are occupied; higher substitution uses numeric locants with the lowest set of numbers while respecting functional-group precedence.</li>
        <li>The aromatic core is often used as a building block in polymers (e.g., polystyrene from styrene) and pharmaceuticals (e.g., aspirin and paracetamol contain a benzene core with specific substitution patterns).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Numbering rule:</strong> Assign the principal functional group at carbon 1, then number around the ring to give the smallest possible set of locants (e.g., 2-chloro-6-methylphenol), so students understand the systematic approach to aromatic nomenclature.</li>
        <li><strong>Substituent handles:</strong> <code>phenyl-</code> indicates a benzene ring attached to a parent chain, while <code>benzyl-</code> indicates the substituent with a CH2 spacer (<code>C6H5CH2-</code>), which influences reactivity and naming.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Toluene (methylbenzene) can lose a hydrogen to give a phenyl or benzyl substituent; this explains why benzyl chloride (<code>C6H5CH2Cl</code>) is named differently from chlorobenzene (<code>C6H5Cl</code>).</li>
        <li>The o/m/p notation simplifies the naming of disubstituted benzenes like o-xylene (1,2-dimethylbenzene) while still allowing numeric locants when more than two substituents exist.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>30.3 Aromaticity</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A compound is aromatic if it is cyclic, planar, fully conjugated (each atom provides a p orbital), and contains <code>4n + 2</code> pi-electrons; benzene meets all these criteria with n = 1.</li>
        <li>Aromaticity leads to resonance energy that stabilizes benzene more than a nonaromatic analogue, so the ring avoids addition reactions that would disrupt the pi-cloud.</li>
        <li>Comparing heats of hydrogenation quantifies aromatic stabilization (benzene releases −208 kJ/mol while three isolated double bonds would release ~−348 kJ/mol), showing students how stability is an experimentally measurable concept.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Huckel's rule:</strong> <code>4n + 2</code> pi-electrons (for benzene n = 1 gives 6 pi-electrons). This rule predicts when cyclic conjugated systems gain aromatic stabilization and explains why cyclobutadiene (4 pi-electrons) is unstable.</li>
        <li><strong>Hydrogenation comparison:</strong> Cyclohexene hydrogenation gives −120 kJ/mol, 1,4-cyclohexadiene ~−232 kJ/mol, but benzene hydrogenation is only −208 kJ/mol despite appearing to have three double bonds; the 140 kJ/mol difference is the aromatic stabilization energy.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Cyclohexene reacts quickly with bromine, while benzene does not under the same conditions, reflecting that benzene avoids addition to maintain aromaticity.</li>
        <li>The benzene molecule has equivalent C-C bonds and a circular pi-cloud, so the addition of H2 would break aromaticity and is therefore thermodynamically disfavored compared to hydrogenating isolated alkenes.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>30.4 Acidity of Phenols</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Phenols are more acidic than alcohols because the phenolate ion formed upon deprotonation is resonance stabilized over the aromatic ring, spreading the negative charge.</li>
        <li>The pKa of phenol (~10) versus cyclohexanol (~16) shows that aromatic conjugate bases are stronger acids; electron-withdrawing substituents further stabilize the phenolate ion and lower the pKa.</li>
        <li>Phenols can be deprotonated to phenolate salts (e.g., sodium phenoxide) that are soluble in water and useful in synthesis or as intermediates for separation based on acidity differences.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Acidity vs resonance:</strong> <code>PhOH + OH- -> PhO- + H2O</code>; the phenolate ion distributes the negative charge across the aromatic ring via resonance contributors, while aliphatic alkoxides cannot delocalize charge and are less stable.</li>
        <li><strong>pKa comparison:</strong> <code>pKa(phenol) ≈ 10</code>, <code>pKa(cyclohexanol) ≈ 16</code>, showing that students can interpret a lower pKa as greater acidity due to stronger conjugate base stabilization.</li>
        <li><strong>Inductive effects:</strong> Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO2) ortho/para to the OH further stabilize the phenolate and lower pKa; electron-donating groups (e.g., OCH3) raise pKa by destabilizing the anion.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Deprotonating phenol with NaOH yields sodium phenoxide, which dissolves in water whereas phenol itself is sparingly soluble; acidifying the solution regenerates phenol.</li>
        <li>Nitrophenols are stronger acids than phenol, so mixing nitrophenol and cyclohexanol with aqueous NaOH allows selective dissolution of the nitrophenolate salt for separation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>30.5 Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS) Reactions</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>EAS involves two steps: attack of an electrophile to form a Wheland (sigma) complex, then deprotonation to regain aromaticity; the aromatic stabilization is the driving force for substitution instead of addition.</li>
        <li>Common EAS reactions include halogenation (Cl+, Br+), nitration (NO2+), sulfonation (SO3H+), and Friedel–Crafts alkylation/acylation (R+ or RCO+ with AlCl3), each with typical reagents listed in Table 30.2.</li>
        <li>Substituent effects govern regioselectivity: electron-donating groups activate and direct to ortho/para, halogens are deactivating yet ortho/para-directing, and electron-withdrawing groups deactivate and direct to the meta position.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>General mechanism:</strong> <code>ArH + E+ -> [Ar-E-H]+ (Wheland) -> ArE + H+</code>. The first slow step forms a resonance-stabilized carbocation; the second removes H+ so aromaticity returns, explaining why addition reactions are avoided.</li>
        <li><strong>Directing effects:</strong> <code>EDG (e.g., NH2, OH, OR) -> ortho/para</code>, <code>EWG (e.g., NO2, SO3H, CF3) -> meta</code>, while <code>halogens -> ortho/para but slow due to inductive deactivation</code>. This explains how the substituent's electron-pushing/pulling behavior tunes both rate and site of attack.</li>
        <li><strong>Reagent examples (Table 30.2):</strong> <code>Nitration: HNO3/H2SO4 -> NO2+</code>, <code>Halogenation: Cl2/FeCl3 -> Cl+</code>, <code>Sulfonation: SO3/H2SO4 -> SO3H+</code>, <code>Friedel–Crafts: RCl/AlCl3 -> R+</code> (or RCOCl/AlCl3 -> RCO+). These formulas help students connect reagents to electrophiles.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Toluene nitrates faster than benzene because the methyl group donates electron density, activating the ring and favoring ortho/para substitution; nitrobenzene nitrates much slower because NO2 withdraws electrons and destabilizes the sigma complex.</li>
        <li>Halogenating bromobenzene still gives ortho/para products even though bromine is deactivating; its resonance donation overrides the inductive pull in directing the electrophile.</li>
      </ul>
