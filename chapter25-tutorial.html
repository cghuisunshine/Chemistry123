    <h1>Chapter 25 Tutorial — Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>25.1 Stereochemistry in Organic Chemistry</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Stereochemistry describes three-dimensional arrangements of atoms, which influences physical properties and biological activity (e.g., limonene enantiomers smell like lemons vs. oranges).</li>
        <li>Isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in connectivity (constitutional) or spatial arrangement (stereoisomers: geometric, enantiomers, diastereomers, meso).</li>
        <li>Enantiomers are nonsuperimposable mirror images; they behave identically in achiral environments but differently in chiral settings.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Enantiomeric relationship:</strong> Mirror-image tetrahedral centers giving opposite arrangements (R vs. S) are enantiomers and rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Limonene exists as two enantiomers: one interacts with receptors to smell like lemons, the other like oranges, showing the biological importance of stereochemistry.</p>

      <h2>25.2 Cis–Trans Isomerism in Cycloalkanes</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Cycloalkanes adopt chair conformations with axial and equatorial hydrogens; steric strain is minimized when bulky substituents occupy equatorial positions.</li>
        <li>Cis/trans stereochemistry arises when substituents are on the same (cis) or opposite (trans) faces of a ring or double bond.</li>
        <li>1,3-diaxial interactions destabilize axial substituents; methylcyclohexane prefers the equatorial methyl.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cycloalkane formula:</strong> `CnH2n`. Compared to alkanes, ring closure removes two hydrogens.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>In cyclohexane, the chair form is ∼30 kJ/mol more stable than the boat; equatorial substituents avoid 1,3-diaxial clashes.</p>

      <h2>25.3 Chirality in Organic Compounds</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Chiral stereocenters have four different groups; molecules with such centers exist as enantiomeric pairs with identical connectivity but opposite spatial arrangements.</li>
        <li>Chiral molecules become enantiomerically distinct only in chiral environments (e.g., enzymes, polarized light).</li>
        <li>Meso compounds contain stereocenters but have internal symmetry, making them achiral despite stereochemistry.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stereoisomer count:</strong> Maximum `2ⁿ` for n stereocenters; meso symmetry can reduce the actual number because one configuration is identical to its mirror image.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>2,3-dibromobutane has three stereoisomers: a meso form (achiral) plus a pair of enantiomers.</p>

      <h2>25.4 Measuring Optical Activity</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Plane-polarized light is rotated by chiral molecules: dextrorotatory (d, +) rotates right, levorotatory (l, −) rotates left; racemic mixtures show zero net rotation.</li>
        <li>Specific rotation `[α]` normalizes observed rotation by path length and concentration: `[α] = α_obs/(l·c)`.
        </li>
        <li>Enantiomeric excess (ee) measures deviation from racemic mixtures; ee = |(%R − %S)|.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Specific rotation:</strong> `[α] = α_obs/(l·c)` where α_obs is measured rotation (degrees), l is path length (dm), and c is concentration (g/mL).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Racemic mixtures (50:50 enantiomers) have zero optical rotation because equal and opposite effects cancel.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>25.5 Absolute Stereochemistry</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>R/S configuration uses priority rules (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog) to assign absolute stereochemistry: orient the lowest-priority group away, trace 1→2→3, and assign R (clockwise) or S (counterclockwise).</li>
        <li>Enantiomers have opposite R/S assignments at each stereocenter.
        </li>
        <li>Meso compounds can have stereocenters but are achiral due to internal symmetry.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>R/S assignment steps:</strong> (1) Rank substituents by atomic number, (2) orient lowest priority away, (3) determine direction of 1→2→3. Clockwise = R, counterclockwise = S.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>A chiral carbon with substituents ranked to give clockwise order is R; reversing two groups or flipping orientation swaps to S.</p>

      <h2>25.6 Molecules with More than One Stereocenter</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Multiple stereocenters produce diastereomers (non-mirror-image stereoisomers) and enantiomers; meso symmetry can reduce the STEM count.</li>
        <li>Diastereomers have distinct physical properties, making them easier to separate than enantiomers.
        </li>
        <li>Molecules such as tartaric acid illustrate meso forms (achiral) plus enantiomeric pairs despite multiple stereocenters.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Maximum stereoisomers:</strong> `2ⁿ` for n stereocenters when no symmetry; actual number may be lower if meso forms exist.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Glyceraldehyde has one stereocenter (R/S). Tartaric acid’s two centers give three stereoisomers: meso (achiral) + enantiomeric pair.</p>
