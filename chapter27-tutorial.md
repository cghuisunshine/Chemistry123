# Chapter 27 Tutorial — Alcohols, Haloalkanes, and Ethers

## 27.1 Alcohols: Structure, Properties, and Nomenclature
### Key ideas
- Alcohols are hydrocarbons with one or more OH groups; the oxygen is sp³ hybridized and forms two lone pairs, enabling hydrogen bonding.
- OH groups raise boiling points and solubility in water via hydrogen bonding; longer alkyl chains reduce polarity and solubility in water but increase hydrocarbon compatibility.
- Alcohols are named by identifying the longest carbon chain containing the OH, numbering to give the OH the lowest locant, and changing `-ane` to `-ol`. Primary, secondary, and tertiary classifications depend on how many carbons attach to the OH-bearing carbon.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Hydrogen bonding:** OH---O interactions (≈20 kJ/mol) increase cohesive forces compared to alkanes.
- **Solubility trend:** As alkyl chain length increases, water solubility decreases because the hydrophobic portion dominates O–H’s polar character.

### Short example(s)
- Ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) circulates as a polar solvent and beverage ingredient, while glycerol (HOCH₂CH(OH)CH₂OH) uses three OH groups to remain highly water soluble.

## 27.2 Haloalkanes
### Key ideas
- Haloalkanes (alkyl halides) contain C–X bonds (X = F, Cl, Br, I); the halogen’s size/polarizability influences reactivity and physical properties.
- Carbon-halogen bond strength decreases down the group, so iodides react more readily in substitutions.
- Haloalkanes are typically prepared indirectly from alcohols or via halogen addition to alkenes.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Halogenation:** `R–OH + HX → R–X + H₂O` (acid-catalyzed substitution); tertiary carbocations form fastest, giving tertiary haloalkanes.

### Short example(s)
- 2-methyl-2-propanol reacts with HBr at room temperature to give 2-bromo-2-methylpropane because the tertiary carbocation intermediate is most stable.

## 27.3 Ethers: Structure, Properties, and Nomenclature
### Key ideas
- Ethers (`R–O–R'`) contain two alkyl (or aryl) groups linked through an oxygen; they cannot hydrogen bond as donors, so they have lower boiling points than isomeric alcohols.
- Acyclic ethers are named by listing the alkyl groups alphabetically with the suffix `-ether` (common) or as `alkoxyalkane` (systematic). Cyclic ethers (e.g., tetrahydrofuran, THF) are heterocycles named after the ring size.
- Crown ethers and related macrocycles complex metal ions and act as phase-transfer catalysts.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Ether general formula:** `R–O–R'`. The oxygen has two lone pairs and forms two sigma bonds; bond angles are near 110°.

### Short example(s)
- Diethyl ether (CH₃CH₂-O-CH₂CH₃) is more volatile than butanol of the same formula; 18-crown-6 encapsulates K⁺, enabling solubilization of inorganic salts in organic solvents.

## 27.4 Reactions of Alcohols
### Key ideas
- Alcohols deprotonate with alkali metals to form alkoxides (strong bases/nucleophiles) and hydrogen gas; they protonate under acid to give oxonium ions leading to carbocations.
- Four oxidation products (ethers, alkenes, haloalkanes, carbonyls) arise from alcohols via substitution, elimination, or oxidation.
- Basicity enables dehydration (loss of H₂O) and substitution; carbocation stability (3° > 2° > 1°) drives the path.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Alkoxide formation:** `2 ROH + 2 Na → 2 RONa + H₂`.
- **Carbocation formation:** `R–OH + H⁺ → R–OH₂⁺ → R⁺ + H₂O`; the leaving water requires acid catalysis.

### Short example(s)
- Ethanol treated with Na gives sodium ethoxide; protonation/dehydration of 2-methyl-2-propanol forms a tertiary carbocation that can lose water to give 2-methylpropene or react with halides.

## 27.5 Nucleophilic Substitution Reactions of Haloalkanes
### Key ideas
- Haloalkanes undergo substitutions (`SN1` via carbocation, `SN2` via concerted attack); tertiary haloalkanes usually follow SN1, where carbocation formation is rate-determining.
- Nucleophiles attack the carbocation to form new bonds; reactivity correlates with leaving group ability (I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻).
- SN2 occurs with inversion of configuration at tertiary center and requires strong nucleophiles and polar aprotic solvents.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **SN1 rate law:** `Rate = k[R–X]` because only haloalkane’s ionization is slow. **SN2 rate:** `Rate = k[R–X][Nu⁻]` because nucleophile participates in transition state.

### Short example(s)
- Potassium iodide in acetone converts a bromide to an iodide by SN2; tertiary alcohol dehydration to alkene competes with substitution under acidic condition.

## 27.6 Haloalkanes to Alkenes: β-Elimination
### Key ideas
- Haloalkanes eliminate HX under base to form alkenes (E2) or via carbocations (E1); β-elimination removes a hydrogen from the β-carbon.
- Strong bases (OH⁻, RO⁻) encourage E2 with anti-periplanar geometry; tertiary haloalkanes favor E1 because carbocations are stable.
- E/Z stereochemistry arises when elimination yields internal alkenes.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **E2 mechanism:** `R–CH₂–CHX–CH₃ + Base → R–CH=CH–CH₃ + X⁻ + H–Base⁺` via concerted removal.

### Short example(s)
- 2-bromobutane treated with ethanolic KOH gives but-2-ene as the major product with trans geometry due to anti-periplanar requirement.

## 27.7 Substitution versus Elimination
### Key ideas
- Substitution (SN1/SN2) and elimination (E1/E2) compete; stronger bases and higher temperatures push elimination, while strong nucleophiles favor substitution.
- Secondary substrates exhibit both pathways; reaction conditions (solvent, base) tune the outcome.
- Polar protic solvents stabilize ions (favor SN1/E1) whereas polar aprotic favor SN2/E2.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Competition trends:** `strong bulky base → E2`, `strong nucleophile, weak base → SN2`, `weak nucleophile → SN1/E1` if tertiary center.

### Short example(s)
- Heating 2-bromobutane with t-BuOK (bulky base) yields 2-butene (E2) rather than substitution, while NaN₃ in DMSO gives substitution.
