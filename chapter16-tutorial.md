# Chapter 16 Tutorial — Acid–Base Equilibria

## 16.1 Acid–Base Equilibria
### Key ideas
- Acids donate H⁺ and bases accept H⁺ (Brønsted-Lowry); water can act as both (amphoterism) and participates in equilibrium with acids/bases.
- Every acid–base reaction is an equilibrium between protonated and deprotonated forms.
- Strong acids/bases lie far to one side of their equilibrium because the conjugate species is too weak to appreciably reverse the process.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **General equilibrium:** `HA + B ⇌ A⁻ + BH⁺`; equilibrium lies to the right when acid is strong, to left if base is weak.
- **Ka and Kb:** Acid dissociation constant `K_a = [H₃O⁺][A⁻]/[HA]` quantifies acid strength; large `K_a` implies strong acid.

### Short example(s)
- HCl in water dissociates nearly completely, so `[H⁺] ≈ [Cl⁻]` and `K_a` is very large (strong acid).

## 16.2 Autoionization of Water
### Key ideas
- Water self-ionizes: `2 H₂O ⇌ H₃O⁺ + OH⁻`; the equilibrium constant `K_w = [H₃O⁺][OH⁻] ≈ 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴` at 25 °C.
- This sets the background levels of hydronium and hydroxide in pure water and allows calculation of pH for neutral solutions.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Ion-product constant:** `K_w = [H₃O⁺][OH⁻]`; increasing temperature raises `K_w`.

### Short example(s)
- Pure water has `[H₃O⁺] = [OH⁻] = 1.0 × 10⁻⁷ M`, so `pH = 7`.

## 16.3 The pH Scale
### Key ideas
- pH is a logarithmic measure: `pH = -log[H₃O⁺]`; similarly `pOH = -log[OH⁻]` and `pH + pOH = pK_w`.
- Small changes in pH correspond to large changes in `[H₃O⁺]` because each pH unit is a tenfold difference.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **pH definition:** `pH = -log[H₃O⁺]`; `[H₃O⁺] = 10^{-pH}`.
- **pH + pOH = 14** at 25 °C because `K_w = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴`.

### Short example(s)
- A solution with `[H₃O⁺] = 1.0 × 10⁻³ M` has `pH = 3` and is acidic.

## 16.4 Strong Acids and Bases
### Key ideas
- Strong acids/bases dissociate completely in water, so the equilibrium lies almost entirely to products.
- Their `K_a` or `K_b` is large; thus you can treat `[H₃O⁺]` as equal to the initial acid concentration.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Strong acid assumption:** For `HA → H⁺ + A⁻`, `[H₃O⁺] ≈ [HA]_initial` and `pH = -log([HA]_initial)`.

### Short example(s)
- 0.1 M HNO₃ gives `[H₃O⁺] ≈ 0.1 M`, so `pH = 1`.

## 16.5 Weak Acids
### Key ideas
- Weak acids only partially ionize; equilibria yield `K_a` expressions and require ICE tables to solve.
- For a weak acid HA: `K_a = x²/([HA]_0 - x)` where `x = [H₃O⁺]` at equilibrium; use approximation `x ≪ [HA]_0` to simplify.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Ka expression:** `K_a = [H₃O⁺][A⁻]/[HA]`; solving gives `[H₃O⁺] ≈ √(K_a·[HA]_0)` when `K_a` small.

### Short example(s)
- 0.10 M acetic acid (`K_a ≈ 1.8 × 10⁻⁵`) gives `[H₃O⁺] ≈ √(1.8×10⁻⁵ × 0.10) ≈ 1.34×10⁻³ M`, so `pH ≈ 2.87`.

## 16.6 Weak Bases
### Key ideas
- Analogous to weak acids; use `K_b = [BH⁺][OH⁻]/[B]` and similar approximations.
- Once `[OH⁻]` is known, convert to `pOH` and then to `pH` (`pH + pOH = 14`).

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Kb expression:** Solve `K_b = x²/([B]_0 - x)` for `[OH⁻]`, typically using `x ≪ [B]_0` for weak bases.

### Short example(s)
- 0.10 M NH₃ (`K_b ≈ 1.8 × 10⁻⁵`) gives `[OH⁻] ≈ √(K_b·[NH₃]) ≈ 1.34×10⁻³ M`, so `pOH ≈ 2.87` and `pH ≈ 11.13`.

## 16.7 Acid–Base Properties of Salt Solutions
### Key ideas
- Salts from strong acid + strong base are neutral; those with weak acid or base components hydrolyze to produce acidic or basic solutions.
- The relative strengths of conjugate acids/bases determine whether hydrolysis shifts equilibrium toward producing H⁺ or OH⁻.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Hydrolysis example:** `NH₃` (base) in water: `NH₃ + H₂O ⇌ NH₄⁺ + OH⁻`; `K_b` governs `[OH⁻]` generation, and salts like `NH₄Cl` are acidic because `NH₄⁺` releases H⁺.

### Short example(s)
- NaCH₃COO solution is basic because CH₃COO⁻ acts like a weak base; NaCl solution is neutral.

## 16.8 Acid–Base Behavior and Chemical Structure
### Key ideas
- Acid strength depends on bond polarity, bond energy, and resonance stabilization of conjugate base; electronegativity and atomic radius trends apply across the periodic table.
- Structural features such as inductive effects (electron-withdrawing groups) stabilize conjugate bases and increase acidity.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- No single formula; use structural rules: stronger acids have weaker H–X bonds (longer, less energy) and more resonance in their conjugates.

### Short example(s)
- HCl is stronger than HF because the H–Cl bond is longer/weaker; carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., CF₃COOH) are stronger due to stabilized conjugate base.
