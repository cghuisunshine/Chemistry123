    <h1>Chapter 13 Tutorial — Properties of Solutions</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>13.1 The Solution Process</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Solutions form when solute particles disperse uniformly in a solvent, driven by entropy yet moderated by intermolecular forces.</li>
        <li>Three energetic steps determine the process: breaking solute–solute and solvent–solvent interactions (endothermic) and making solute–solvent attractions (exothermic).</li>
        <li>Spontaneity requires the favorable solute–solvent enthalpy to counterbalance the separation costs, explaining why some salts dissolve only in polar solvents.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Enthalpy of solution:</strong> <code>ΔH_soln = ΔH_solute + ΔH_solvent + ΔH_mix</code>. If strong solute–solvent interactions (ΔH_mix negative) compensate for the energetic costs, the salt dissolves.</li>
        <li><strong>Ion–dipole solvation:</strong> Polar water aligns its partial charges toward ions (oxygen toward Na⁺, hydrogens toward Cl⁻), releasing hydration energy that overcomes lattice enthalpy.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>NaCl dissolves endothermically by breaking ionic lattice and water hydrogen bonds while releasing ion–dipole hydration energy (~+3.9 kJ/mol overall).</p>

      <h2>13.2 Saturated Solutions and Solubility</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Saturated solutions contain the maximum dissolved solute at given conditions; any extra solute remains undissolved and a dynamic equilibrium prevails.</li>
        <li>Solubility curves plot solute amount vs. temperature; solids typically become more soluble with heat, while gases become less soluble.</li>
        <li>Gaseous solubility also depends on pressure via Henry’s law.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Solubility expression:</strong> Moles or grams of solute per 100 g solvent (or per liter) provide a numerical value `s` for the curve.</li>
        <li><strong>Henry’s law:</strong> <code>P_gas = k_H · [gas]</code>; increasing pressure raises the amount dissolved in liquids proportionally.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Carbonated beverages remain fizzy because CO₂ solubility is maintained under high pressure; once opened, pressure drops and CO₂ effuses until equilibrium is reestablished.</p>

      <h2>13.3 Factors Affecting Solubility</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>“Like dissolves like”: polar solvents dissolve polar solutes via dipole interactions, while nonpolar solvents rely on dispersion forces.</li>
        <li>Temperature raises the solubility of solids (endothermic dissolution) but lowers that of gases.</li>
        <li>Pressure strongly affects gases (Henry’s law) but not solids or liquids.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>**Qualitative rule:** Stronger solute–solvent interactions vs. solute–solute/solvent–solvent interactions determine whether a solution forms.</li>
        <li>**Le Chatelier:** For endothermic ΔH_soln > 0, raising temperature increases solubility; exothermic dissolutions show the opposite trend.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Sugar dissolves faster in hot tea because heat helps disrupt sugar–sugar hydrogen bonds; oxygen becomes less soluble in warm water, which is why warm lakes hold less dissolved O₂.</p>

      <h2>13.4 Expressing Solution Concentration</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Concentrations can be reported as mass percent, molarity, molality, mole fraction, or ppm/ppb depending on the application.</li>
        <li>Molarity depends on solution volume and thus varies with temperature, while molality depends on solvent mass and stays constant with heating.</li>
        <li>Mole fractions describe composition in mole-based terms and are useful for gas mixtures and Raoult’s law.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Molarity:</strong> <code>M = n_solute / V_solution</code> (mol/L).</li>
        <li><strong>Molality:</strong> <code>m = n_solute / m_solvent</code> (mol/kg), ideal for colligative properties.</li>
        <li><strong>Mole fraction:</strong> <code>X_i = n_i / Σn_j</code>, used in Raoult’s law and Dalton’s law.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>0.5 mol NaCl dissolved to give 0.25 L solution yields 2.0 M, whereas the same solute in 0.2 kg water gives 2.5 molal; heating changes only the molarity.</p>

      <h2>13.5 Colligative Properties</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Colligative properties depend on solute particle count, not identity: vapor-pressure lowering, boiling-point elevation, freezing-point depression, and osmotic pressure.</li>
        <li>Nonvolatile solutes reduce the solvent’s vapor pressure according to their mole fraction.</li>
        <li>Osmotic pressure is the hydrostatic pressure needed to stop solvent flow through a semipermeable membrane.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Raoult’s law:</strong> <code>P_solution = X_solvent · P°_solvent</code>; each solute molecule reduces solvent vapor pressure proportionally.</li>
        <li><strong>Boiling point elevation:</strong> <code>ΔT_b = K_b · m · i</code>; <strong>Freezing point depression:</strong> <code>ΔT_f = K_f · m · i</code>, where `m` is molality and `i` is van ’t Hoff factor.</li>
        <li><strong>Osmotic pressure:</strong> <code>Π = M · R · T</code> for dilute solutions (M molarity), measuring the pressure needed to stop osmosis.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Adding 1 mol NaCl (i ≈ 2) to water increases the boiling point by `ΔT_b = K_b · m · 2`, making salted water boil above 100 °C and lowering the freezing point for de-icing roads.</p>

      <h2>13.6 Colloids</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Colloids contain particles 1 nm–1 μm; they scatter light (Tyndall effect) and do not settle readily.</li>
        <li>Unlike true solutions, colloidal particles are large enough to experience Brownian motion but too small to precipitate.</li>
        <li>Charged surfaces, surfactants, or steric stabilization prevent particles from aggregating and maintain dispersion.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tyndall scattering:</strong> Intensity ∝ particle size², explaining why colloids appear cloudy while solutions stay clear.</li>
        <li><strong>Zeta potential:</strong> A surface charge measure; high zeta potential (positive or negative) keeps particles repelling each other and stable.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Milk is a colloid of fat droplets in water; emulsifiers coat the fat droplets to keep them from coalescing, and the Tyndall effect makes milk opaque.</p>
