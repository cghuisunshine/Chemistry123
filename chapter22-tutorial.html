    <h1>Chapter 22 Tutorial — Chemistry of the Nonmetals</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>22.1 Periodic Trends and Chemical Reactions</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Nonmetals gather the highest electronegativities and small radii in the upper-right of the periodic table, so they favor molecular bonding instead of ionic lattices.</li>
        <li>The first element in each group (H, C, N, O) is small enough to form strong π bonds and stays limited to fewer bonded neighbors compared with heavier congeners.</li>
        <li>Combustion and proton-transfer reactions dominate nonmetal chemistry because O–H, C=O, and N≡N bonds are thermodynamically very stable.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Combustion (Equation 22.1):</strong> <code>4 CH₃NHNH₂ + 9 O₂ → 4 CO₂ + 10 H₂O + 2 N₂</code>. Bond enthalpies for O–H (463 kJ/mol), C=O (799 kJ/mol), and N≡N (941 kJ/mol) mean the products are energetically favored and the reaction releases a lot of heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Strong-base proton acceptance (Equation 22.2):</strong> <code>CH₃⁻ + H₂O → CH₄ + OH⁻</code>. A very weak acid like methane forms the strong base OH⁻ when it removes a proton from water.</li>
        <li><strong>Nitride protonation (Equation 22.3):</strong> <code>N³⁻ + 3 H₂O → NH₃ + 3 OH⁻</code>. Nitride gains protons instantly, generating ammonia and hydroxide ions due to its extreme basicity.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Burning CH₃NHNH₂ gives CO₂, H₂O, and N₂, while Mg₃P₂ + H₂O yields PH₃ plus Mg(OH)₂, illustrating the textbook combustion and acid–base templates.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>22.2 Hydrogen</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Hydrogen is unique: it can behave like a proton donor (H⁺) or an electron acceptor (H⁻), yet it stands apart from any specific family.</li>
        <li>Three isotopes exist—protium (¹H), deuterium (²H), and tritium (³H)—and their mass differences produce measurable kinetic isotope effects.</li>
        <li>Hydrogen forms a strong H–H bond (1436 kJ/mol) and must be activated by heat, irradiation, or catalysts before it participates in reactions.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tritium decay (Equation 22.4):</strong> <code>³H → ²He + ⁻₁e</code> with t₁/₂ = 12.3 yr, meaning each tritium nucleus halves every 12.3 years and decays to helium-3 while emitting a beta particle.</li>
        <li><strong>Acid‑metal reduction (Equation 22.7):</strong> <code>Zn + 2 H⁺ → Zn²⁺ + H₂</code>. An active metal plus acid liberates hydrogen gas, which is the usual lab preparation of H₂.</li>
        <li><strong>Steam reforming (Equation 22.8):</strong> <code>CH₄ + H₂O → CO + 3 H₂</code> followed by the <strong>water-gas shift (22.9):</strong> <code>CO + H₂O → CO₂ + H₂</code>. Together they describe industrial manufacture where methane and steam make CO and H₂, then CO is turned into CO₂ with more hydrogen.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduction of oxides (Equation 22.6):</strong> <code>CuO + H₂ → Cu + H₂O</code>. Hydrogen removes oxygen from solid copper oxide, yielding the metallic element and water.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p><code>Zn + 2 HCl → ZnCl₂ + H₂</code> is the classroom version of Equation 22.7; acid strength controls how quickly hydrogen appears above the flask.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>22.3 Group 18: The Noble Gases</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Noble gases have filled valence shells, so they exhibit high ionization energies and minimal chemical reactivity.</li>
        <li>Physical applications—lightning displays, inert shielding, cryogenics—use their noble-gas properties rather than chemistry.</li>
        <li>Heavier noble gases, especially xenon, can expand their valence shells and form stable fluorides and oxides under forcing conditions.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Xenon hydrolysis (Equation 22.16):</strong> <code>XeF₆ + 3 H₂O → XeO₃ + 6 HF</code>. Water converts xenon fluoride to xenon trioxide plus hydrofluoric acid, showing how even “inert” atoms can enter covalent chemistry when matched with strong oxidizers.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>The VSEPR model predicts square-planar XeF₄ because six electron domains (four bonds plus two lone pairs) arrange octahedrally, with lone pairs opposite each other to minimize repulsion.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>22.4 Group 17: The Halogens</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Halogens (F, Cl, Br, I) are strong oxidizing agents because of their high electronegativities and high reduction potentials.</li>
        <li>A halogen can oxidize the halide ions below it in the group, which explains halogen displacement reactions and practical uses like disinfecting water.</li>
        <li>They form hydrohalic acids, oxyacids, and interhalogen compounds, giving rise to materials from bleach to Teflon®.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Reduction potential (Equation 22.17):</strong> <code>F₂ + 2 e⁻ → 2 F⁻</code> with <code>E° = +1.80 V</code>. A large positive potential signals that fluorine strongly attracts electrons, making it the harshest oxidant in the group.</li>
        <li><strong>Chlorine hydrolysis (Equation 22.18):</strong> <code>Cl₂ + 2 OH⁻ → Cl⁻ + ClO⁻ + H₂O</code>. Chlorine reacting with base yields chloride and hypochlorite, the bleaching species in household bleaches.</li>
        <li><strong>HF + silica (Equation 22.19):</strong> <code>SiO₂ + 6 HF → H₂SiF₆ + 2 H₂O</code>. Hydrofluoric acid attacks silicates because fluoride forms strong bonds with silicon and pulls oxygen into soluble fluoro complexes.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p><code>2 I⁻ + Br₂ → I₂ + 2 Br⁻</code> shows bromine oxidizing iodide, producing the brown iodine color that identifies the reaction.</p>

      <h2>22.5 Oxygen</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Oxygen is produced by liquefying air or via photosynthesis, and it is the most-used industrial oxidant (steel, welding, bleaching).</li>
        <li>Ozone (O₃) is a powerful oxidizer and forms/disintegrates readily; in the stratosphere it shields UV, while near Earth it damages lungs.</li>
        <li>Oxides can behave as acids (nonmetal oxides), bases (metal oxides), or both (amphoteric), and special O–O species (peroxides, superoxides) fuel breathing apparatus and bleaching reactions.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Photosynthesis (Equation 22.20):</strong> <code>6 CO₂ + 6 H₂O → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6 O₂</code>. Plants convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen using sunlight; the oxygen is released back into the atmosphere.</li>
        <li><strong>Ozone dynamics (Equations 22.21–22.22):</strong> <code>O₃ → O₂ + O</code> and <code>3 O₂ → 2 O₃</code>. Ozone decomposes into molecular oxygen and reactive atoms, and it reforms when oxygen is energized (e.g., lightning).</li>
        <li><strong>SO₂ hydrolysis (Equation 22.23):</strong> <code>SO₂ + H₂O → H₂SO₃</code>. Sulfur dioxide dissolves in water to form sulfurous acid, central to acid rain chemistry.</li>
        <li><strong>Basic oxide hydration (Equation 22.24):</strong> <code>O²⁻ + H₂O → 2 OH⁻</code>. The oxide ion from ionic oxides quickly forms hydroxide ions in water, justifying the basic nature of metal oxides.</li>
        <li><strong>Superoxide hydration (Equation 22.26):</strong> <code>4 KO₂ + 2 H₂O → 4 K⁺ + 4 OH⁻ + 3 O₂</code>. Moisture in respiration triggers this reaction and cleans CO₂ with KOH, making KO₂ ideal for breathing masks.</li>
        <li><strong>Hydrogen peroxide disproportionation (Equation 22.28):</strong> <code>2 H₂O₂ → 2 H₂O + O₂</code> (ΔH° = −196.1 kJ). One oxygen atom is reduced (−1 to −2) and another oxidized (−1 to 0), making H₂O₂ both an oxidizer and reducer.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Oxyacetylene welding uses <code>2 C₂H₂ + 5 O₂ → 4 CO₂ + 2 H₂O</code> to make flames hotter than 3000 °C for cutting and joining metals.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>22.6 The Other Group 16 Elements: S, Se, Te, and Po</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Other Group 16 elements have ns²np⁴ valence electrons and can reach −2 or positive oxidation states up to +6, thanks to expanded valence shells.</li>
        <li>Sulfur is central to industry (sulfuric acid, vulcanized rubber) and agriculture but also causes pollution when burned.</li>
        <li>Selenium and tellurium appear in electronics and pigments, while polonium is radioactive and rare.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Phosphate reduction (Equation 22.43):</strong> <code>2 Ca₃(PO₄)₂ + 6 SiO₂ + 10 C → P₄ + 6 CaSiO₃ + 10 CO</code>. Carbon and silica reduce phosphate rock to elemental phosphorus; the slag and carbon monoxide are removed.</li>
        <li><strong>SO₃ hydration (Equations 22.29–22.30):</strong> <code>SO₃ + H₂SO₄ → H₂S₂O₇</code> followed by <code>H₂S₂O₇ + H₂O → 2 H₂SO₄</code>. Instead of directly hydrating SO₃, it dissolves in sulfuric acid to form pyrosulfuric acid, which is safer to handle before the final acid step.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Rust removal uses <code>Fe₂O₃ + 6 H⁺ → 2 Fe³⁺ + 3 H₂O</code>, dissolving iron oxide with acid so the metal can be recoated.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>22.7 Nitrogen</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Nitrogen exists mainly as N₂ with a triple bond; its inertness means special processes (like Haber) are needed to “fix” it into reactive forms.</li>
        <li>The element spans oxidation states from −3 to +5, enabling a wide variety of redox chemistry in fertilizers, explosives, and biological molecules.</li>
        <li>Hydrogen-rich molecules like NH₃, N₂H₄, and NH₂OH are key industrial feedstocks and reducing agents.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Haber process (Equation 22.34):</strong> <code>N₂ + 3 H₂ ⇌ 2 NH₃</code>. High pressure and catalysts push this equilibrium toward ammonia, making it the backbone of fertilizer manufacture.</li>
        <li><strong>Ammonia release (Equation 22.33):</strong> <code>NH₄Cl + NaOH → NH₃ + H₂O + NaCl</code>. Base abstracts a proton from ammonium, yielding volatile ammonia gas.</li>
        <li><strong>Hydrazine synthesis (Equation 22.35):</strong> <code>2 NH₃ + OCl⁻ → N₂H₄ + Cl⁻ + H₂O</code>. Hypochlorite converts ammonia into hydrazine, which serves as rocket fuel and corrosion inhibitor.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>On reacting hydroxylamine with Cu²⁺, you obtain <code>Cu²⁺ + 2 NH₂OH → Cu + N₂ + 2 H₂O + 2 H⁺</code>, a balanced redox equation featuring N₂ as the oxidation product.</p>

      <h2>22.8 The Other Group 15 Elements: P, As, Sb, and Bi</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>These elements have ns²np³ valence electrons and smoothly transition from nonmetal (P) to metallic (Bi).</li>
        <li>Phosphorus forms highly reactive P₄ molecules (white phosphorus) that convert to less reactive red phosphorus upon heating.</li>
        <li>Halides (PCl₃, PCl₅) and oxyacids dominate phosphorus utility—in detergents, plastics, and fertilizers.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Phosphate reduction (Equation 22.43):</strong> repeated for context—see earlier description.</li>
        <li><strong>Phosphorus chlorides (Equations 22.44–22.45):</strong> <code>2 P + 3 Cl₂ → 2 PCl₃</code> and <code>PCl₃ + Cl₂ ⇌ PCl₅</code>. Chlorine oxidizes phosphorus to +3, and excess Cl₂ pushes it to the pentachloride, demonstrating controlled oxidation.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>White phosphorus spontaneously combusts in air, while heating it to ~400 °C yields red phosphorus, showing how bonding and strain dictate allotrope stability.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>22.9 Carbon</h2>

        <li>Carbon catenates to form countless organic molecules and allotropic solids (diamond, graphite, nanotubes) with contrasting properties.</li>
        <li>CO and CO₂ arise in fuels and metallurgy, while carbonates, carbonic acid, and carbides highlight inorganic carbon’s versatility.</li>
        <li>Carbon dioxide is mildly acidic in water, making it responsible for carbonated drinks, greenhouse warming, and limestone dissolution.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Carbon monoxide formation (Equation 22.52):</strong> <code>2 C + O₂ → 2 CO</code>. Limited oxygen gives CO, which binds strongly to hemoglobin and is still used as a reducing agent.</li>
        <li><strong>CO oxidation (Equation 22.53):</strong> <code>2 CO + O₂ → 2 CO₂</code> (ΔH° = -566 kJ). CO burns to CO₂, releasing energy and eliminating toxicity.</li>
        <li><strong>Metal reduction (Equation 22.54):</strong> <code>Fe₃O₄ + 4 CO → 3 Fe + 4 CO₂</code>. CO reduces iron oxide to metal in a blast furnace.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Carbonate decomposition (Equation 22.56):</strong> <code>CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂</code>. Heating limestone gives lime and carbon dioxide for cement.</li>
        <li><strong>Acid + carbonate (Equation 22.57):</strong> <code>CO₃²⁻ + 2 H⁺ → CO₂ + H₂O</code>. Acid neutralization releases ferric gas, a classic lab demonstration.</li>
        <li><strong>Carbide hydrolysis (Equation 22.65):</strong> <code>CaC₂ + 2 H₂O → Ca(OH)₂ + C₂H₂</code>. Water liberates acetylene from calcium carbide, useful for welding.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Adding vinegar (acetic acid) to sodium bicarbonate makes bubbles of CO₂ via <code>NaHCO₃ + H⁺ → Na⁺ + CO₂ + H₂O</code>, the same reaction that lifts baked goods.</p>

      <h2>22.10 The Other Group 14 Elements: Si, Ge, Sn, and Pb</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Group 14 moves from nonmetal (C) to semimetal (Si, Ge) to metals (Sn, Pb), with bond strengths that steadily decline.</li>
        <li>Silicon is abundant, supplies semiconductors after careful purification, and always bonds to oxygen to form silicates/glass.
        </li>
        <li>Silicones (polymers with Si–O backbones and organic side groups) and glass formulations exploit wide chemical stability and flexibility.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Silicon reduction (Equation 22.66):</strong> <code>SiO₂ + 2 C → Si + 2 CO</code>. Carbon reduces silica to elemental silicon plus carbon monoxide, the basic metallurgical route.</li>
        <li><strong>Purified Si (Equation 22.67):</strong> <code>SiCl₄ + 2 H₂ → Si + 4 HCl</code>. This gas-phase reaction regenerates solid silicon after distilling the volatile tetrachloride.</li>
        <li><strong>Glass precursors (Equations 22.68–22.69):</strong> <code>CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂</code> and <code>Na₂CO₃ → Na₂O + CO₂</code>. Lime and soda lower silica’s melting point for mass-market glass production.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Zone refining sweeps impurities toward one end of a silicon rod by moving a molten zone; the remaining solid is ultrapure (up to 11 nines!), suitable for chips.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>22.11 Boron</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Boron is the only nonmetal in Group 13, forming electron-deficient clusters called boranes and extended borate networks.</li>
        <li>Diborane (B₂H₆) features bridging hydrogens because each boron has only six electrons, so the hydrogens share bonding pairs between two boron atoms.</li>
        <li>Borates and borohydrides are used in lifestyle products (borax laundry soap), reducing agents (NaBH₄), and neutralizing washes (boric acid).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Diborane combustion (Equation 22.70):</strong> <code>B₂H₆ + 3 O₂ → B₂O₃ + 3 H₂O</code> (ΔH° = −2030 kJ). The electron-poor borane is oxidized to stable boric oxide and water, releasing tremendous energy.</li>
        <li><strong>Boric acid condensation (Equation 22.71):</strong> <code>4 H₃BO₃ → H₂B₄O₇ + 5 H₂O</code>. Heat drives water off boric acid, forming tetraboric acid (borate) plus water—the same process forms borax from boric acid.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Sodium borohydride contains the BH₄⁻ ion, a strong hydride donor that safely reduces aldehydes/ketones and metal ions in organic synthesis.</p>
