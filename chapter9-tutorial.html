    <section>
      <h2>9.1 Molecular Shapes</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>AB<em>n</em> molecules (central atom A with n identical B atoms) link Lewis connectivity to three-dimensional shape.</li>
        <li>Bond angles between nuclei fix shape and size; identical bonds imply symmetric geometries.</li>
        <li>Five parent geometries (linear, trigonal planar, tetrahedral, trigonal bipyramidal, octahedral) and derived variants (bent, trigonal pyramidal, T-shaped) explain most AB<em>n</em> shapes.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AB<em>n</em> formula:</strong> One atom A with n identical B atoms; n determines the parent geometry and the characteristic angles needed to space electron domains evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Characteristic bond angles:</strong> linear 180°, trigonal planar 120°, tetrahedral ≈ 109.5°, trigonal bipyramidal 120° equatorial/90° axial, octahedral 90°; these degrees show how far apart bonds must point to minimize electronic repulsion.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>CCl<sub>4</sub> has a tetrahedral arrangement with Cl–C–Cl angles of 109.5° and equal bond lengths (178 pm); removing one vertex of that tetrahedron gives trigonal pyramidal and bent fragments such as NH<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

      <h2>9.2 The VSEPR Model</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Electron domains—each single, double, triple bond or lone pair—act like repelling balloons that adopt geometries minimizing Coulombic repulsions.</li>
        <li>Electron-domain geometry (all domains) may differ from molecular geometry (only bonded atoms); lone pairs reshape the observable bond angles.</li>
        <li>Lone pairs and multiple bonds occupy more space, reducing adjacent angles; in trigonal bipyramids lone pairs prefer equatorial sites, while octahedral lone pairs occupy opposite vertices to yield square-planar shapes.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Prediction steps:</strong> (1) Draw the Lewis structure and count electron domains, (2) choose the electron-domain geometry that separates those domains, and (3) describe the molecular geometry by focusing only on bonded atoms; this aligns connectivity with space.</li>
        <li><strong>Domain angles (Table 9.1):</strong> 2 domains → 180° (linear), 3 → 120° (trigonal planar), 4 → 109.5° (tetrahedral), 5 → 120°/90° (trigonal bipyramid), 6 → 90° (octahedral); these angles designate the ideal spacing between electron domains.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>NH<sub>3</sub>: four domains → tetrahedral electron-domain geometry; ignoring the lone pair leaves three bonds in a trigonal pyramidal arrangement (~107°). CO<sub>2</sub>: two double bonds count as two domains, so the molecule is linear (180°). SF<sub>4</sub>: five domains with one lone pair give a trigonal bipyramid with a seesaw molecular shape.</p>

      <h2>9.3 Molecular Shape and Molecular Polarity</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Bond dipoles arise from electronegativity differences; each is a vector pointing toward the more electronegative atom.</li>
        <li>Dipole moment of a molecule equals the vector sum of its bond dipoles; symmetry can cancel vectors while asymmetry produces a net dipole.</li>
        <li>Symmetric AB<em>n</em> frameworks with identical outer atoms (e.g., linear AB<sub>2</sub>, trigonal planar AB<sub>3</sub>, tetrahedral AB<sub>4</sub>, trigonal bipyramidal AB<sub>5</sub>, octahedral AB<sub>6</sub>) are nonpolar despite polar bonds.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Vector sum of bond dipoles:</strong> µ<sub>total</sub> = Σµ<sub>bond</sub> vectors. Each vector has magnitude (in Debye) and direction; equal but opposite vectors cancel, while unequal vectors give a nonzero µ<sub>total</sub>, measuring overall charge separation.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>CO<sub>2</sub>: two equal C=O dipoles oppose each other along the same axis, so µ<sub>total</sub> = 0 (nonpolar). H<sub>2</sub>O: two O–H dipoles add because the molecule is bent, resulting in µ ≈ 1.85 D directed toward oxygen (polar). BF<sub>3</sub> and CCl<sub>4</sub> are nonpolar thanks to symmetric trigonal planar/tetrahedral shape despite polar bonds.</p>

      <h2>9.4 Covalent Bonding and Orbital Overlap</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Valence-bond theory pictures covalent bonds forming when atomic orbitals overlap and concentrate electron density between nuclei.</li>
        <li>σ bonds form by head-on overlap along the internuclear axis; π bonds come from sideways overlap of p orbitals above and below that axis.</li>
        <li>Bond length corresponds to the internuclear distance that minimizes potential energy, balancing attraction and repulsion.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Multiple bond composition:</strong> single bond = σ, double = σ + π, triple = σ + 2π. Each π bond adds electron density above/below the axis, introduces rotational rigidity, and strengthens the bond.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>H<sub>2</sub>: two 1s orbitals overlap head-on to give a σ bond with a potential-energy minimum at 74 pm. Cl<sub>2</sub>: two 3p orbitals overlap end-to-end to produce a σ bond, while HCl results from overlap between H 1s and Cl 3p orbitals.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>9.5 Hybrid Orbitals</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Hybrids mix s and p orbitals (e.g., sp, sp2, sp3) to create directed orbitals whose orientations match VSEPR-predicted electron-domain geometries.</li>
        <li>Every atomic orbital involved produces one hybrid orbital; all hybrids are equivalent and point toward bonding/lone-pair regions.</li>
        <li>Hybridization works best when the central atom has at most an octet; Period 3+ hypervalent molecules need a more complex description because their d orbitals lie too high in energy.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hybridization geometry table:</strong> s + p → sp (linear, 180°); s + 2p → sp2 (trigonal planar, 120°); s + 3p → sp3 (tetrahedral, 109.5°). Use the electron-domain geometry to choose the corresponding hybrid set.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>BeF<sub>2</sub>: Be mixes 2s + 2p → two sp hybrids opposite each other, giving a linear molecule. BF<sub>3</sub>: sp2 hybrids lie in a plane at 120° and bond to three F atoms. CH<sub>4</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O: sp3 hybrids place four orbitals in a tetrahedral arrangement; NH<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O use some hybrids for lone pairs, compressing bond angles.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>9.6 Multiple Bonds</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Double bonds comprise one σ and one π bond; triple bonds add a second π bond.</li>
        <li>π bonds arise only when unhybridized p orbitals overlap sideways, so atoms with sp or sp2 hybridization supply the needed p orbitals.</li>
        <li>Delocalized π systems (benzene, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>) spread electrons over several atoms, equalizing bond lengths, stabilizing the molecule, and constraining it to be planar.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Double/triple bond structure:</strong> Double bond = σ + π, triple bond = σ + 2π. σ bonds localize between two atoms, while π bonds provide additional overlap regions above and below the bond axis, increasing bond strength and restricting rotation.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Ethene: each carbon forms σ bonds via sp2 hybrids, and the remaining p orbitals form the π bond, holding the carbons and hydrogens in one plane. Ethyne: sp hybrids create the σ scaffold, while two π bonds arise from the perpendicular p orbitals, giving a linear triple bond. Benzene and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> each host six delocalized π electrons shared equally among atoms.</p>

      <h2>9.7 Molecular Orbitals</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>MOs form by constructive (bonding) or destructive (antibonding) combinations of atomic orbitals. Antibonding MOs have nodal planes that exclude electron density between atoms.</li>
        <li>Electrons fill MOs according to Aufbau-like rules (two per orbital, Hund’s rule for degeneracy), producing an electronic configuration for the molecule.</li>
        <li>Bond order compares bonding and antibonding electrons to estimate molecular stability.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bond order (Eq. 9.1):</strong> Bond order = ½ (number of bonding electrons − number of antibonding electrons). This quantity counts effective electron pairs that hold the atoms together and has no units; a bond order of 1 indicates a single bond, 2 a double bond, etc.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>H<sub>2</sub>: two electrons occupy σ(1s1s), so bond order = ½(2 − 0) = 1. He<sub>2</sub>: both σ and σ* are filled, giving bond order = ½(2 − 2) = 0 (no stable molecule). He<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>: three electrons lead to bond order = ½(2 − 1) = ½, a weakly bonded ion.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>9.8 Bonding in Period 2 Diatomic Molecules</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Period 2 diatomics mix the 2s and 2p orbitals to produce σ and π MOs; σ<sub>2p</sub> sits above π<sub>2p</sub> for B<sub>2</sub>/C<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> but drops below π<sub>2p</sub> for O<sub>2</sub>/F<sub>2</sub>/Ne<sub>2</sub> because of stronger s–p interaction.</li>
        <li>MO rules: the number of MOs equals the number of atomic orbitals, orbitals mix best with similar energy, overlap increases splitting, each MO holds two electrons, and Hund’s rule applies to degenerate levels.</li>
        <li>Bond order predicts bond length/enthalpy and magnetic behavior; unpaired electrons yield paramagnetism (O<sub>2</sub>), while completely paired electrons yield diamagnetism (N<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>2s–2p interaction energy shift:</strong> Mixing between 2s and 2p orbitals lowers σ<sub>2s</sub> and raises σ<sub>2p</sub>, altering the order relative to π orbitals. This shift explains why B<sub>2</sub>/C<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> have higher-energy σ<sub>2p</sub> than O<sub>2</sub>/F<sub>2</sub>/Ne<sub>2</sub>, changing the location of unpaired electrons.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>B<sub>2</sub>: configuration σ<sub>2s</sub><sup>2</sup> σ*<sub>2s</sub><sup>2</sup> π<sub>2p</sub><sup>1</sup> π<sub>2p</sub><sup>1</sup> (bond order 1, paramagnetic). O<sub>2</sub>: filling π*<sub>2p</sub><sup>2</sup> produces two unpaired electrons and bond order 2, matching its paramagnetism and bond length (121 pm). NO: unequal atomic orbital energies skew the MOs toward oxygen, but 11 electrons still give bond order 2½ and one unpaired electron, aligning with its bond length (115 pm) and radical reactivity.</p>
