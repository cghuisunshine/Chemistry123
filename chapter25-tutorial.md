# Chapter 25 Tutorial — Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds

## 25.1 Stereochemistry in Organic Chemistry
### Key ideas
- Stereochemistry focuses on the 3-D arrangement of atoms in molecules, which determines properties such as smell (limonene enantiomers) and biological activity.
- Isomers share a molecular formula but can differ in connectivity (constitutional isomers) or spatial orientation (stereoisomers: geometric, enantiomers, diastereomers, meso).
- For tetrahedral centers with four different substituents, mirror images are non-superimposable enantiomers distinguished only in chiral environments.

### Important formulas &amp; their meaning
- **Enantiomeric relationship:** If two structures are nonsuperimposable mirror images, they are enantiomers; they have identical connectivity but opposite spatial arrangement, leading to opposite optical rotation.

### Short example(s)
- Limonene has two enantiomers—one smells like oranges, the other like lemons—illustrating how stereochemistry affects biological receptors.

## 25.2 Cis–Trans Isomerism in Cycloalkanes
### Key ideas
- Cycloalkanes adopt specific conformations (e.g., cyclohexane chair versus boat) to relieve angle/torsional strain; chair hydrogens alternate axial/equatorial.
- Disubstituted cyclohexanes exhibit cis/trans stereochemistry depending on whether substituents lie on the same or opposite faces; equatorial positions minimize steric hindrance.
- Cis/trans designators also describe different substituent positions across double bonds or rings where rotation is restricted.

### Important formulas &amp; their meaning
- **Cycloalkane formula:** `CnH2n` because ring closure removes two hydrogens compared to alkanes; thus cyclohexane is C₆H₁₂.

### Short example(s)
- Methylcyclohexane prefers the equatorial methyl to avoid 1,3-diaxial interactions that arise when the methyl is axial.

## 25.3 Chirality in Organic Compounds
### Key ideas
- A chiral center (stereocenter) has four different substituents; such a carbon is a stereogenic center giving rise to two enantiomers.
- Chiral molecules are not superimposable on their mirror images; they exist as enantiomeric pairs that behave differently in chiral environments.
- Meso compounds contain stereocenters but possess an internal plane of symmetry, making them achiral despite stereochemistry.

### Important formulas &amp; their meaning
- **Number of stereoisomers:** Maximum `2ⁿ` for n chiral centers, though symmetry (meso) can reduce the number.

### Short example(s)
- 2,3-dibromobutane has three stereoisomers: two enantiomers (meso absence) and one meso form that is achiral due to internal symmetry.

## 25.4 Measuring Optical Activity
### Key ideas
- Chiral molecules rotate plane-polarized light: dextrorotatory (d or +) rotates to the right, levorotary (l or −) to the left; racemic mixtures have no net rotation.
- The observed rotation depends on concentration, path length, and specific rotation ([α]ᵀᵒˣ), which is a compound constant at temperature T and wavelength (usually D line).
- Polarimeters measure rotation; enantiomeric excess (ee) quantifies how far a mixture departs from racemic.

### Important formulas &amp; their meaning
- **Specific rotation:** `[α] = α_obs / (l·c)` where α_obs is observed rotation in degrees, l path length in dm, c concentration in g/mL.

### Short example(s)
- A racemic mixture (50:50 enantiomers) gives zero optical rotation because equal and opposite rotations cancel.

## 25.5 Absolute Stereochemistry
### Key ideas
- R/S notation uses the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules to assign configuration to chiral centers: highest priority substituent receives 1, lowest 4 (often hydrogen) is placed away; clockwise → R, counterclockwise → S.
- Enantiomers have opposite R/S assignments at every stereocenter.
- Meso compounds can still have stereocenters but remain achiral because they have an internal mirror plane.

### Important formulas &amp; their meaning
- **R/S assignment flow:** (1) Rank substituents by atomic number; (2) orient molecule so lowest priority points away; (3) trace from 1→2→3; clockwise = R, counterclockwise = S.

### Short example(s)
- 2-chlorobutane has one stereocenter; if the priorities give clockwise when lowest (H) is back, the configuration is R (otherwise S).

## 25.6 Molecules with More than One Stereocenter
### Key ideas
- Multiple stereocenters can generate diastereomers (not mirror images) and enantiomers; meso forms reduce expected `2ⁿ` count when symmetry exists.
- Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by standard techniques unlike enantiomers.
- Molecules with multiple stereocenters require systematic R/S assignment at each center and consideration of meso symmetry.

### Important formulas &amp; their meaning
- **Diastereomer count:** For n stereocenters without symmetry, `2ⁿ` stereoisomers; meso compounds lower the actual number because one configuration may be achiral.

### Short example(s)
- Tartaric acid (HOOC-CHOH-CHOH-COOH) has two stereocenters: the meso form (internal mirror plane) is achiral, while the other two are enantiomeric.
