# Chapter 15 Tutorial — Chemical Equilibrium

## 15.1 The Concept of Equilibrium
### Key ideas
- Chemical equilibrium occurs when forward and reverse reaction rates are equal, so concentrations of reactants and products become constant while both reactions continue dynamically.
- Equilibrium can arise regardless of starting materials, and it requires a closed system where species cannot escape.
- The equilibrium position reflects the balance of rates; shifting conditions (temperature, concentration, pressure) can shift the composition while rates stay matched.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Rate equality:** At equilibrium ` rate_forward = rate_reverse`; thus `k_f [A]^{a}... = k_r [B]^{b}...` and the ratio of rate constants equals the equilibrium constant `K` (Equation 15.5).
- **Dynamic equilibrium:** Although macroscopic concentrations are static, molecules continuously interconvert, a hallmark of equilibrium systems.

### Short example(s)
- NO₂ ⇌ N₂O₄ shows color change until equilibrium; once achieved, the mixture stays brownish because the forward (dimerization) and reverse (dissociation) rates are equal.

## 15.2 The Equilibrium Constant
### Key ideas
- For a general reaction `aA + bB ⇌ cC + dD`, the equilibrium constant `K_c` is `[C]^c[D]^d/[A]^a[B]^b` measured at a specific temperature.
- `K_p` for gas-phase reactions uses partial pressures, and `K_p = K_c(RT)^Δn` where Δn = moles of gaseous products − reactants.
- `K` indicates direction: `K ≫ 1` favors products, `K ≪ 1` favors reactants; `K = 1` gives comparable amounts.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Equilibrium expression:** `K_c = [products]^{coeff}/[reactants]^{coeff}` (Equation 15.7). Only species in the equilibrium are included, and solids/pure liquids are omitted because their concentrations remain constant.
- **K_p and K_c relation:** `K_p = K_c(RT)^Δn`, connecting concentration- and pressure-based constants via the gas constant and temperature.

### Short example(s)
- For `N₂ + 3 H₂ ⇌ 2 NH₃`, `K_c = [NH₃]^2/[N₂][H₂]^3`; at 450 °C this constant is small so high pressure and removal of NH₃ are used industrially to shift equilibrium toward ammonia.

## 15.3 Understanding and Working with Equilibrium Constants
### Key ideas
- Manipulating equations changes constants: reversing a reaction inverts `K`, multiplying coefficients raises `K` to that power, and combining mechanisms multiplies their `K`s.
- Equilibrium constant values are fixed at a given temperature; changing temperature alters the numerical `K` depending on the reaction’s enthalpy.
- Knowing `K` and initial concentrations, you can predict equilibrium concentrations by ICE (Initial-Change-Equilibrium) tables.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Algebraic manipulation:** If `K₁` for `A ⇌ B` is known, then `K` for `2A ⇌ 2B` is `K₁²`; reversing gives `K = 1/K₁`.
- **ICE tables:** Start with initial values, represent changes with `x`, and solve for `x` using the equilibrium expression equated to `K`.

### Short example(s)
- If `K = 4` for `A ⇌ B`, the reverse reaction has `K = 1/4`; combining it with another `K = 2` reaction gives an overall `K = 0.5`.

## 15.4 Calculating Equilibrium Constants
### Key ideas
- Experimental concentrations at equilibrium let you plug into `K` directly; solving ICE tables often involves quadratic equations.
- If additional equilibrium data (e.g., shifts upon changing amounts) are known, they can be used to back-calculate `K`.
- Approximate methods like assuming `x ≪ initial` expedite calculations when `K` is very small.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **ICE approach:** `[A]_eq = [A]_0 − ax`, `[B]_eq = [B]_0 + bx`, then substitute into `K` to solve for `x`.
- **Small-x approximation:** If the change is less than 5% of the initial concentration, `x` can be neglected in denominators, simplifying algebra.

### Short example(s)
- For `CO + H₂ ⇌ CH₃OH`, if initial `[CO]=1.0 M`, `[H₂]=2.0 M`, and equilibrium `[CH₃OH]=0.4 M`, use ICE to compute `[CO]` and `[H₂]` and then `K_c`.

## 15.5 Le Châtelier’s Principle
### Key ideas
- A system at equilibrium responds to stress (concentration, pressure, temperature changes) by shifting to counter the perturbation and restore equilibrium.
- Increasing reactant concentration shifts toward products, raising product concentration until a new equilibrium is reached; reducing volume favors the side with fewer moles of gas.
- Temperature changes shift `K`: heating endothermic reactions increases `K`, cooling decreases it; the system absorbs or releases heat accordingly.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Le Châtelier’s Principle:** When a change is imposed, the reaction shifts direction to minimize that change; no equation but the qualitative rule guides predictions.
- **Pressure effect:** For gaseous equilibria, adding pressure by reducing volume favors the side with fewer gas moles; adding an inert gas at constant volume has no effect.

### Short example(s)
- For `N₂ + 3 H₂ ⇌ 2 NH₃`, increasing pressure pushes equilibrium toward NH₃ (fewer moles) and raising temperature shifts equilibrium toward reactants if the reaction is exothermic.
