# Chapter 11 Tutorial — Liquids and Intermolecular Forces

## 11.1 A Molecular Comparison of Gases, Liquids, and Solids
### Key ideas
- The three states differ because of the balance between kinetic energy (motions set by temperature) and intermolecular attractions (forces pulling particles together).
- Gases have widely separated particles and negligible attractions, liquids have closer particles that remain mobile, and solids have tightly bound particles fixed in position.
- Changing temperature or pressure shifts the balance; heating boosts kinetic energy to overcome attractions, while increasing pressure brings molecules closer so attractions dominate.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Average kinetic energy:** `KE_avg ∝ T` (from kinetic theory and Equation 10.19). Higher temperature raises the average kinetic energy so molecules explore more space and resist attraction—key to understanding why gases expand and solids melt when heated.
- **State density trend:** Density(gas) << density(liquid) ≈ density(solid). This empirical relationship mirrors the increasing effectiveness of intermolecular forces as particles pack closer in the condensed phases.

### Short example(s)
- Halogens illustrate the trend: I₂ is a solid, Br₂ a liquid, and Cl₂ a gas at room temperature because molar mass (and thus dispersion forces) decreases going up the group, so kinetic energy wins more easily.

## 11.2 Intermolecular Forces
### Key ideas
- Intermolecular forces (IMFs) are electrostatic attractions between molecules: dispersion (instantaneous dipoles), dipole–dipole, hydrogen bonding, and, when ions are present, ion–dipole interactions.
- London dispersion forces arise even in nonpolar species because electron motion creates instantaneous dipoles that polarize neighbors; the strength grows with polarizability (more electrons, larger volume).
- Molecular shape, polarity, and hydrogen bonding dramatically influence boiling points, viscosities, and surface properties because these forces dictate how tightly molecules stick together and how easily they separate.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Dispersion energy scale:** `E_disp ∝ α₁α₂/r⁶`, where `α` is polarizability and `r` is intermolecular distance. Bigger, more polarizable molecules have stronger induced dipoles and thus higher boiling points, as seen from the halogens and noble gases (Figure 11.5).
- **Dipole–dipole alignment:** For polar molecules, the dipole contribution to intermolecular energy scales with their permanent dipole moments: `E_dd ∝ μ²/r³`. Larger dipoles (CH₃CN vs propane) yield stronger attractions, raising boiling points beyond what dispersion alone would predict.

### Short example(s)
- Acetonitrile (boiling point 355 K) and propane (231 K) have similar molar masses, but acetonitrile’s permanent dipole accounts for the much higher boiling point compared to nonpolar propane.
- HF hydrogen bonds (a special case of dipole–dipole) make its boiling 293 K vs HCl’s 188 K even though both are small molecules.

## 11.3 Select Properties of Liquids
### Key ideas
- Viscosity measures how resistant a liquid is to flow; stronger IMFs and larger, more entangled molecules increase viscosity, while higher temperature supplies kinetic energy that helps molecules slide past each other.
- Surface tension is the energy required to increase surface area; surface molecules feel a net inward pull because they lack neighbors above them, so liquids with strong IMFs (water, mercury) resist area increase and form beads.
- Capillary action emerges when adhesive forces to a surface exceed cohesive forces; liquids climb narrow tubes (or fabrics draw sweat) until surface tension and gravity balance.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Surface tension:** `γ = E/A`, the energy required to increase surface area by unit `A`. For water, `γ ≈ 7.29 × 10⁻² J/m²` at 20 °C, indicating strong cohesion (hydrogen bonding) that keeps droplets spherical.
- **Viscosity trend:** `η ∝ exp(Eₐ/RT)` (qualitative Arrhenius-type behavior). The activation energy `Eₐ` represents the IMF hurdles to flow, so raising `T` decreases `η` exponentially, explaining why octane’s viscosity drops from 7.06 × 10⁻⁴ kg·m⁻¹·s⁻¹ at 0 °C to 4.33 × 10⁻⁴ at 40 °C.

### Short example(s)
- Structural shape matters: long alkanes show increasing viscosity from hexane to decane because their chains tangle more and experience greater dispersion interactions (Table 11.3).
- Capillary action lets water climb narrow tubes because adhesive forces to glass exceed cohesive water–water attractions, producing a concave meniscus; mercury shows a convex meniscus because cohesion dominates.

## 11.4 Phase Changes
### Key ideas
- Phase changes are transitions between solid, liquid, and gas; each step absorbs or releases energy, e.g., melting (fusion) or vaporization, and occurs at characteristic temperatures under a given pressure.
- Heating curves plot temperature vs heat; during a phase change (horizontal segments), added energy goes into breaking IMFs rather than raising temperature.
- Critical temperature is the maximum at which a liquid can exist; above it, the distinction between liquid and gas disappears, and the fluid becomes supercritical regardless of pressure.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Enthalpy relationships:** `∆H_sub = ∆H_fus + ∆H_vap`. Sublimation (solid → gas) requires the combined energies of melting and vaporizing, so knowing two of the heats lets you find the third—for water, `47 kJ/mol = 6 + 40 kJ/mol`.
- **Phase equilibrium:** At boiling point, vapor pressure equals external pressure; `∆H_vap` is the energy required to separate molecules from the liquid (e.g., 40.7 kJ/mol for water), explaining why evaporation cools the surroundings.

### Short example(s)
- The heating curve for water shows plateaus at 0 °C and 100 °C where melting and boiling occur; while heat is added, temperature stays constant until the entire phase converts (Figure 11.22).
- Raising the pressure on water vapor at 110 °C pushes condensation only when pressure exceeds ~143 kPa, and above the critical temperature of 374 °C even huge pressures cannot produce a distinct liquid—this is the critical point behavior.
