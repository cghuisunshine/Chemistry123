# Chapter 22 Tutorial — Chemistry of the Nonmetals

## 22.1 Periodic Trends and Chemical Reactions
### Key ideas
- Nonmetals occupy the upper-right of the periodic table with high electronegativity and small radii, so they hold on to electrons tightly and typically form molecular substances instead of ionic lattices.
- The first element of each nonmetal group (H, C, N, O) is small enough to form strong π bonds and restricted coordination, while the heavier congeners prefer single bonds and expanded valence shells.
- Common nonmetal reactions include combustion (producing CO₂, H₂O, N₂) and proton-transfer pathways, reflecting the strong bonds formed by O–H, C=O, and N≡N.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Example combustion (Equation 22.1):** `4 CH₃NHNH₂ + 9 O₂ → 4 CO₂ + 10 H₂O + 2 N₂`. The stable products reflect high bond enthalpies for O–H (463 kJ/mol), C=O (799 kJ/mol), and N≡N (941 kJ/mol), so the reaction liberates a large amount of energy per mole of fuel.
- **Strong-base proton capture (Equation 22.2):** `CH₃⁻ + H₂O → CH₄ + OH⁻`. A very weak acid like CH₄ reacts with water to give an extremely strong base (OH⁻), showing why the conjugate base of a weak acid is a strong base.
- **Nitride protonation (Equation 22.3):** `N³⁻ + 3 H₂O → NH₃ + 3 OH⁻`. Nitride is such a strong base that it immediately pulls protons from water, making hydroxide ions while producing ammonia.

### Short example(s)
- **Predicted products (Sample Exercise 22.2):** `CH₃NHNH₂ + O₂` burns to give `CO₂ + H₂O + N₂`, while `Mg₃P₂ + H₂O` yields `PH₃ + Mg(OH)₂`. Balancing these shows how combustion and acid–base chemistry capture the stability of molecular nonmetal products.

## 22.2 Hydrogen
### Key ideas
- Hydrogen lies outside any group; it can behave like a halogen (forming H⁻) or like an alkali metal (forming H⁺) but is unique because it has only a 1s electron.
- Three isotopes exist: protium (¹H, ~99.98%), deuterium (²H, D, 0.016%), and tritium (³H, radioactive, t₁/₂ = 12.3 yr). Heavier isotopes alter physical properties and reaction rates (kinetic isotope effect).
- H₂ forms a strong covalent bond (bond enthalpy 1436 kJ/mol) and is used as a reducing agent or fuel only after activation (heat, catalysts, or irradiation).

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Tritium decay (Equation 22.4):** `³H → ²He + ⁻₁e`. The half-life of 12.3 years means each ³H nucleus has a 50% chance of decaying in that time; tritium must be generated rather than stored for long-term use.
- **Metal + acid (Equation 22.7):** `Zn + 2 H⁺ → Zn²⁺ + H₂`. Dissolving an active metal in dilute acid liberates H₂ gas and shows how acid strength controls gas evolution.
- **Steam reforming (Equation 22.8):** `CH₄ + H₂O → CO + 3 H₂`; **water-gas shift (22.9):** `CO + H₂O → CO₂ + H₂`. Together they describe industrial H₂ production: methane plus steam gives CO and H₂, and the CO is shifted to CO₂ with more H₂.
- **Reduction of metal oxide (Equation 22.6):** `CuO + H₂ → Cu + H₂O`. Hydrogen removes oxygen from a solid oxide, explaining its role as an industrial reducing agent.

### Short example(s)
- **Lab generation:** `Zn + 2 HCl → ZnCl₂ + H₂` (a straightforward version of Equation 22.7) gives hydrogen for classroom experiments, illustrating how acid concentration controls the rate of gas evolution.

## 22.3 Group 18: The Noble Gases
### Key ideas
- Noble gases have filled valence shells (2 electrons for He, 8 for the heavier ones), resulting in exceptionally high ionization energies and low reactivity.
- Most uses exploit physical properties (e.g., lighting with Ar, Kr, Xe, cryogenics with He) rather than chemistry, but heavier noble gases can form covalent compounds if forced.
- Xenon easily expands its valence shell and gives rise to fluorides/oxides, showing that inert gases are not chemically mute.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Hydrolysis of xenon fluoride (Equation 22.16):** `XeF₆ + 3 H₂O → XeO₃ + 6 HF`. Water pulls fluorides off Xe, leaving a +6 xenon trioxide product plus hydrofluoric acid; this illustrates how strong oxidants and highly electronegative partners coax noble gases into compounds.

### Short example(s)
- **VSEPR for XeF₄ (Sample Exercise 22.3):** Xe has 36 valence electrons with four Xe–F bonds and two lone pairs, giving formal octahedral electron geometry and square-planar molecular geometry. The lone pairs sit opposite one another to minimize repulsion.

## 22.4 Group 17: The Halogens
### Key ideas
- The halogens are diatomic nonmetals with high electronegativities and strong oxidizing power that decreases down the group (F > Cl > Br > I).
- Lower halides reduce higher halogens: Cl₂ oxidizes Br⁻ and I⁻ but is not oxidized itself; each halogen can only displace the halides below it.
- Halogens react with water to give oxyacids and with hydrogen to yield hydrohalic acids; fluorine is so strong it oxidizes water directly.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Reduction of halogens (Equation 22.17):** `F₂ + 2 e⁻ → 2 F⁻     E° = +1.80 V`. A large positive potential means fluorine is a very powerful oxidant (it readily steals electrons from other species).
- **Chlorine hydrolyzes (Equation 22.18):** `Cl₂ + 2 OH⁻ → Cl⁻ + ClO⁻ + H₂O`. Chlorine dissolving in base forms chloride and hypochlorite; the latter is the active bleaching species in bleach products.
- **Fluoride + silica (Equation 22.19):** `SiO₂ + 6 HF → H₂SiF₆ + 2 H₂O`. Hydrofluoric acid attacks silicates, unlike other hydrohalic acids, because F⁻ forms strong complexes with Si⁴⁺.

### Short example(s)
- **Displacement (Sample Exercise 22.4a):** `2 I⁻ + Br₂ → I₂ + 2 Br⁻`. Bromine oxidizes iodide to elemental iodine while itself becoming bromide; the brown/red color of I₂ confirms the transformation.

## 22.5 Oxygen
### Key ideas
- Oxygen is produced by air liquefaction or photosynthesis and is the industrial world’s most common oxidant (steelmaking, welding, bleaching).
- Ozone (O₃) is a strong oxidizer and UV shield in the stratosphere but a pollutant at ground level; it forms and decomposes readily.
- Oxygen-containing oxides behave as acids (nonmetal oxides) or bases (metal oxides), and special species like peroxides/superoxides contain unusual O–O bonds.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Photosynthesis (Equation 22.20):** `6 CO₂ + 6 H₂O → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6 O₂`. Sunlight drives CO₂ and water into glucose, releasing oxygen—this nuclear-energy-free process keeps atmospheric O₂ replenished.
- **Ozone reactions (Equations 22.21–22.22):** `O₃ → O₂ + O` (decomposition) and `3 O₂ → 2 O₃` (formation). The exothermic formation (∆H° = +285 kJ) means electrical discharges make ozone, while its decomposition liberates reactive oxygen atoms.
- **SO₂ hydrolysis (Equation 22.23):** `SO₂ + H₂O → H₂SO₃`. Dissolving SO₂ in water gives sulfurous acid, which explains its role in acid rain and sterilization.
- **Basic oxide hydration (Equation 22.24):** `O²⁻ + H₂O → 2 OH⁻`. A metal oxide dissolving in water yields hydroxide; mineral oxides thus generate basic solutions.
- **Superoxide hydration (Equation 22.26):** `4 KO₂ + 2 H₂O → 4 K⁺ + 4 OH⁻ + 3 O₂`. Superoxides provide both oxygen and base for breathing masks because moisture from breath drives this reaction.
- **Peroxide disproportionation (Equation 22.28):** `2 H₂O₂ → 2 H₂O + O₂ (∆H° = -196.1 kJ)`. Hydrogen peroxide decomposes exothermically, simultaneously oxidizing and reducing the same element.

### Short example(s)
- **Oxyacetylene welding:** Burning acetylene with O₂ gives extremely hot flame: `2 C₂H₂ + 5 O₂ → 4 CO₂ + 2 H₂O`. The high enthalpy drives cutting/welding applications.

## 22.6 The Other Group 16 Elements: S, Se, Te, and Po
### Key ideas
- Sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and polonium share an ns²np⁴ valence configuration and most commonly adopt a -2 oxidation state, but they also achieve positive states (up to +6) by expanding their valence shells.
- Sulfur occurs as S₈ rings or polymeric forms and is the precursor to sulfuric acid (the world’s most produced chemical), rubber vulcanization, and sulfur dioxide-based preservatives.
- Selenium and tellurium, though rarer, contribute to electronics, pigments, and alloy chemistry.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Phosphate reduction (Equation 22.43):** `2 Ca₃(PO₄)₂ + 6 SiO₂ + 10 C → P₄ + 6 CaSiO₃ + 10 CO`. Carbon reduces phosphate rock to white phosphorus, which distills out for later use.
- **SO₃ hydration (Equations 22.29–22.30):** `SO₃ + H₂SO₄ → H₂S₂O₇`, then `H₂S₂O₇ + H₂O → 2 H₂SO₄`. Sulfur trioxide dissolves in sulfuric acid to form pyrosulfuric acid, which hydrolyzes to concentrated sulfuric acid; this multi-step route avoids the violent direct hydration of SO₃.

### Short example(s)
- **Rust removal (Equation 22.25):** `Fe₂O₃ + 6 H⁺ → 2 Fe³⁺ + 3 H₂O`. Acid dissolves iron(III) oxide, enabling steel to be cleaned before coating it with protective metals.

## 22.7 Nitrogen
### Key ideas
- Nitrogen enjoys a strong triple bond (N≡N, 941 kJ/mol) that makes N₂ chemically inert; the element spans oxidation states from -3 to +5 and is involved in fertilizers, explosives, and biomolecules.
- The Haber process fixes atmospheric nitrogen as ammonia, which is the feedstock for most nitrogen fertilizers.
- Nitrogen also forms hydrazine, ammonia derivatives, and oxides with diverse uses (rocket propellant, corrosion inhibitors, signaling compounds).

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Ammonia synthesis (Equation 22.34):** `N₂ + 3 H₂ → 2 NH₃`. This equilibrium is driven by high pressure and catalysts; each mole of N₂ yields two moles of NH₃, supplying fertilizer and industrial chemicals.
- **Ammonia preparation (Equation 22.33):** `NH₄Cl + NaOH → NH₃ + H₂O + NaCl`. A base liberates gaseous NH₃ from an ammonium salt, showing the acid/base relationship between NH₄⁺ and NH₃.
- **Hydrazine formation (Equation 22.35):** `2 NH₃ + OCl⁻ → N₂H₄ + Cl⁻ + H₂O`. Hypochlorite oxidizes ammonia, passing through an N–N bond formation; the resulting hydrazine is a powerful reducing agent and rocket fuel.

### Short example(s)
- **Hydroxylamine reduction (Sample Exercise 22.5):** Balancing the half-reactions for `NH₂OH → N₂` and `Cu²⁺ → Cu` gives `Cu²⁺ + 2 NH₂OH → Cu + N₂ + 2 H₂O + 2 H⁺`, illustrating how nitrogen oxyanions enter redox chemistry.

## 22.8 The Other Group 15 Elements: P, As, Sb, and Bi
### Key ideas
- Group 15 elements have ns²np³ valence electrons and a wide range of oxidation states; phosphorus, in particular, balances -3 acids (H₃PO₃), +5 oxides, and dramatic allotropes (white vs. red phosphorus).
- As we go down the group the elements become more metallic, with bismuth behaving like a post-transition metal.
- Phosphorus halides (PCl₃, PCl₅) and oxyacids fuel detergents, plastics, and fertilizers, and phosphate rocks supply commercial phosphorus.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Phosphate reduction (Equation 22.43):** (repeated for emphasis). Carbon reduces Ca₃(PO₄)₂ to P₄; the silicate slag (CaSiO₃) and CO are by-products.
- **Phosphorus chlorides (Equations 22.44–22.45):** `2 P + 3 Cl₂ → 2 PCl₃` and `PCl₃ + Cl₂ ⇌ PCl₅`. Chlorine oxidizes phosphorus to the +3 state, and excess chlorine pushes the equilibrium to the pentachloride. The reversible step helps chemists control the oxidation level.

### Short example(s)
- **Allotropes contrast:** White phosphorus (P₄, tetrahedral, highly strained) ignites in air, while red phosphorus (extended chains) is more stable; the difference explains safety precautions in storage and use.

## 22.9 Carbon
### Key ideas
- Carbon’s ability to catenate (form chains/rings) stems from strong C–C bonding; it has multiple allotropes, from diamond to graphite to nanotubes, each with unique properties.
- Carbon oxides (CO, CO₂) and carbonates dominate inorganic carbon chemistry, appearing in fuels, metallurgy, and the carbon cycle.
- Carbides (CaC₂, WC, SiC) showcase carbon’s versatility: ionic, interstitial, and covalent types fuel acetylene generation and cutting tools.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Incomplete combustion (Equation 22.52):** `2 C + O₂ → 2 CO`. Carbon monoxide forms when oxygen is limited; its strong bond (1072 kJ/mol) makes it a toxic, but useful, fuel/reducing agent.
- **CO oxidation (Equation 22.53):** `2 CO + O₂ → 2 CO₂` (∆H° = -566 kJ). CO burns to CO₂, releasing energy and removing toxicity.
- **Metal oxide reduction (Equation 22.54):** `Fe₃O₄ + 4 CO → 3 Fe + 4 CO₂`. Molten iron is obtained by reducing oxides with CO, showing carbon’s metallurgical role.
- **Carbonate decomposition (Equation 22.56):** `CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂`. Heating limestone yields quicklime and CO₂, a step in cement production.
- **Acid + carbonate (Equation 22.57):** `CO₃²⁻ + 2 H⁺ → CO₂ + H₂O`. Adding acid to a carbonate releases CO₂ gas, a lab method to generate the gas and a key acid-base reaction.
- **Carbide hydrolysis (Equation 22.65):** `CaC₂ + 2 H₂O → Ca(OH)₂ + C₂H₂`. Calcium carbide produces acetylene when treated with water, useful for welding.

### Short example(s)
- **Carbonation in baking (Equation 22.58):** `NaHCO₃ + H⁺ → Na⁺ + CO₂ + H₂O`. CO₂ bubbles expand dough, demonstrating how chemistry directly affects cooking.

## 22.10 The Other Group 14 Elements: Si, Ge, Sn, and Pb
### Key ideas
- Group 14 transitions from nonmetal (C) to semimetal (Si, Ge) to metals (Sn, Pb) as atomic size increases and bond strength falls.
- Silicon is the second most abundant element in Earth’s crust and forms an extensive silicate chemistry that structures the bulk of rocks and glass.
- Silicon and its oxides are purified and processed into semiconductors, glass, and silicones.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Silicon production (Equation 22.66):** `SiO₂ + 2 C → Si + 2 CO`. Carbon reduces silica to elemental silicon and carbon monoxide; this is the industrial route for metallurgical-grade Si.
- **SiCl₄ reduction (Equation 22.67):** `SiCl₄ + 2 H₂ → Si + 4 HCl`. Volatile silicon tetrachloride is purified by distillation and then converted back to high-purity silicon with hydrogen.
- **Glass precursors (Equations 22.68–22.69):** `CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂` and `Na₂CO₃ → Na₂O + CO₂`. Lime and soda are derived from carbonates and lower the melting point of silica; the resulting molten mixture hardens into soda-lime glass.

### Short example(s)
- **Zone refining (Figure 22.30):** Passing a molten zone down a silicon rod sweeps impurities to one end, producing 99.999999999% pure silicon needed for electronics.

## 22.11 Boron
### Key ideas
- Boron is the nonmetallic member of Group 13 with a network solid structure, forming unusual electron-deficient compounds with hydrogen (boranes) and strong Lewis acids like BF₃.
- Diborane (B₂H₆) uses bridging hydrogens to share electron density and compensate for boron’s octet deficit.
- Borates (boric acid, borax) and borohydride salts are useful in cleaning, reducing, and buffering applications.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Diborane combustion (Equation 22.70):** `B₂H₆ + 3 O₂ → B₂O₃ + 3 H₂O` (∆H° = -2030 kJ). The reaction is highly exothermic, reflecting the energetic oxidation of electron-poor boranes to boric oxide and water.
- **Boric acid condensation (Equation 22.71):** `4 H₃BO₃ → H₂B₄O₇ + 5 H₂O`. Heating boric acid forms tetraboric acid (a condensed polyborate) plus water, similar to dehydration steps seen in phosphorus chemistry.

### Short example(s)
- **Borohydride reduction:** NaBH₄ translates to `BH₄⁻` being a strong hydride donor; it reduces aldehydes, ketones, and metal ions, widening its use in organic synthesis and metallurgy.
