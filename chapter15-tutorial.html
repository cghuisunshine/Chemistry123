      <h2>15.1 The Concept of Equilibrium</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Chemical equilibrium occurs when forward and reverse reaction rates are equal, so concentrations of reactants and products become constant while reactions continue dynamically.</li>
        <li>The equilibrium position is independent of how the system was initiated and requires a closed system.
        <li>Even though macroscopic concentrations remain steady, molecules continue interconverting—the equilibrium is dynamic.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rate equality:</strong> At equilibrium, <code>rate_forward = rate_reverse</code>, so <code>k_f[A]^a[B]^b = k_r[C]^c[D]^d</code>; the ratio of rate constants becomes the equilibrium constant.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>In the NO₂ ⇌ N₂O₄ equilibrium the solution color stops changing once rates match, even though molecules keep exchanging.</p>

      <h2>15.2 The Equilibrium Constant</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>For <code>aA + bB ⇌ cC + dD</code>, <code>K_c = [C]^c[D]^d/[A]^a[B]^b</code>; only species with changing concentrations appear, excluding pure solids/liquids.</li>
        <li><code>K_p</code> uses partial pressures: <code>K_p = (P_C)^c(P_D)^d/(P_A)^a(P_B)^b</code>.</li>
        <li><code>K_p</code> and <code>K_c</code> are related by <code>K_p = K_c(RT)^Δn</code>, where Δn is gaseous mole change.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>K expression:</strong> For ammonia synthesis <code>K_c = [NH₃]^2/[N₂][H₂]^3</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Conversion:</strong> <code>K_p = K_c(RT)^Δn</code>; Δn = 2 − (1+3) = −2 for the Haber process.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>At 450 °C the Haber `K_c` is small, so high pressure and NH₃ removal (shifting equilibrium) maximize yield.</p>

      <h2>15.3 Understanding and Working with Equilibrium Constants</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Manipulating the balanced equation alters K: reversing it gives 1/K; multiplying the equation multiplies the exponent (K^n).</li>
        <li>K is constant at a given temperature; changing T shifts K depending on the reaction’s enthalpy.</li>
        <li>ICE tables (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) organize concentrations so you can solve for equilibrium values.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Algebraic rules:</strong> If <code>K₁</code> is known for an equation, reversing it gives <code>K = 1/K₁</code>, adding two equations multiplies their Ks.</li>
        <li><strong>ICE tables:</strong> Write initial concentrations, express changes with `x`, and plug equilibrium expressions into the K equation to solve.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Combining `K₁ = 2` for `A ⇌ B` with `K₂ = 4` for `B ⇌ C` yields `K_total = 8` for `A ⇌ C`.</p>

      <h2>15.4 Calculating Equilibrium Constants</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Plug experimentally determined equilibrium concentrations into the equilibrium expression to compute K.</li>
        <li>Solve quadratic equations from ICE tables; use approximations when `x` is small compared to initial concentrations.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ICE method:</strong> `Δ` terms show stoichiometric change (e.g., `−x` for reactant, `+x` for product) before substituting into `K`.</li>
        <li><strong>Small-x approximation:</strong> If `K` is small and `x` ≪ initial concentration, drop `x` in the denominator to simplify solving.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>If equilibrium gives `[NH₃] = 0.2 M` while `[N₂] = 0.1 M` and `[H₂] = 0.3 M`, plug into `K = [NH₃]^2/[N₂][H₂]^3` to find `K_c`.</p>

      <h2>15.5 Le Châtelier’s Principle</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>If equilibrium is disturbed (by concentration, pressure, temperature), the system shifts to counter the change and re-establish equilibrium.</li>
        <li>Adding reactants shifts toward products; removing products or increasing pressure (if fewer gas moles on product side) shifts toward products.
        <li>Temperature changes alter `K`: heating an endothermic reaction increases `K`, cooling decreases it.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Le Châtelier’s Principle:</strong> A qualitative rule that predicts how equilibrium moves in response to stress.</li>
        <li><strong>Pressure effect:</strong> For gaseous equilibria, increasing total pressure by reducing volume favors the side with fewer moles of gas.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>For `N₂ + 3 H₂ ⇌ 2 NH₃`, raising pressure favors NH₃ because the right side has fewer gas moles; heating shifts toward reactants since the reaction is exothermic.</p>
