# Chapter 9 Tutorial — Molecular Geometry and Bonding Theories

## 9.1 Molecular Shapes
### Key ideas
- Lewis structures show connectivity, but molecular shape depends on how atoms and electron pairs arrange in 3D; ABn molecules (central atom A bound to n identical B atoms) expose this relationship.
- Bond angles formed by lines between nuclei define the shape and size of a molecule; identical bonds around a central atom imply highly symmetric geometries.
- Most ABn shapes descend from five parent geometries — linear, trigonal planar, tetrahedral, trigonal bipyramidal, octahedral — and variants (bent, trigonal pyramidal, T-shaped) emerge when vertices are removed.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **General ABn formula**: An ABn molecule has one central atom A bonded to n B atoms; the value of n guides which parent geometry best separates the B atoms and therefore fixes the characteristic bond angles (e.g., n=4 → tetrahedral at 109.5°). This shows that bond count drives the three-dimensional scaffold.
- **Characteristic bond angles**: Linear = 180°, trigonal planar = 120°, tetrahedral ≈ 109.5°, trigonal bipyramidal = 120° equatorial / 90° axial, octahedral = 90°. These angles are measured in degrees and describe the direction each bond points so that electron domains stay as far apart as possible.

### Short example(s)
- **CCl4**: Lewis structure shows four C–Cl bonds in a plane, but experimentally the Cl atoms sit at tetrahedral vertices with Cl–C–Cl angles of 109.5° and equal bond lengths (178 pm). Removing one vertex of that tetrahedral framework yields trigonal pyramidal and bent arrangements (e.g., NH3 and H2O).

## 9.2 The VSEPR Model
### Key ideas
- Electron domains (each bond or lone pair) behave like repelling balloons; the VSEPR model arranges them to minimize repulsions and predicts electron-domain geometries (linear, trigonal planar, tetrahedral, trigonal bipyramidal, octahedral).
- Molecular geometry reflects only the bonded atoms, so lone pairs alter bond angles by occupying space yet are omitted from the molecular-geometry description.
- Lone pairs and multiple bonds are “fatter” electron domains, compressing adjacent bond angles; in trigonal bipyramidal geometries, nonbonding domains prefer equatorial positions, while in octahedral geometries two lone pairs occupy opposite vertices to become square planar.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Electron-domain counting & prediction steps**:
  1. Draw the Lewis structure and count electron domains (each bond, double bond, triple bond, or lone pair counts as one domain).
  2. Select the electron-domain geometry from Table 9.1 so that domains maximize separation (two domains → linear, three → trigonal planar, etc.).
  3. Derive the molecular geometry by focusing on the positions of bonded atoms only (lone pairs are invisible but crowd the space). These steps link connectivity to geometry.
- **Electron-domains vs angles (Table 9.1)**: 2 domains → 180° (linear), 3 → 120° (trigonal planar), 4 → 109.5° (tetrahedral), 5 → 120°/90° (trigonal bipyramid), 6 → 90° (octahedral). These degrees describe how far apart electron pairs must be to minimize repulsion.

### Short example(s)
- **NH3**: Four electron domains (three N–H bonds plus one lone pair) give a tetrahedral electron-domain geometry. Considering only the three bonding domains results in a trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry with bond angles near 107°.
- **CO2**: Two electron domains (each double bond counts as one) align linearly at 180°, so the O–C–O molecular geometry is linear and nonpolar.
- **SF4**: Five electron domains (four bonds, one lone pair) adopt a trigonal bipyramid; the lone pair prefers an equatorial site, producing a seesaw molecular geometry.

## 9.3 Molecular Shape and Molecular Polarity
### Key ideas
- Bond polarity arises from electronegativity differences; each bond dipole is a vector directing toward the more electronegative atom.
- A molecule’s dipole moment equals the vector sum of its bond dipoles. Symmetry can cancel those vectors (nonpolar), while asymmetry leaves a net dipole (polar).
- Symmetrical ABn shapes with identical B atoms (e.g., AB2 linear, AB3 trigonal planar, AB4 tetrahedral, AB5 trigonal bipyramidal, AB6 octahedral) are inherently nonpolar even if individual bonds are polar.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Vector sum of bond dipoles**: The overall dipole moment `µ_total = Σ µ_bond vectors`. Units are Debye (D), and the direction and magnitude reflect charge separation in space. If vectors cancel, µ_total = 0 (nonpolar); if they reinforce, µ_total > 0 (polar). This formula tells students that shape, not just bond polarity, determines molecular polarity.

### Short example(s)
- **CO2**: Two equal C=O bond dipoles point in opposite directions along the same axis, canceling out, so µ_total = 0 and CO2 is nonpolar.
- **H2O**: Two identical O–H dipoles do not oppose each other because the molecule is bent, so their vector sum yields µ ≈ 1.85 D pointing toward oxygen; water is polar.
- **BF3 vs NH3**: BF3’s trigonal planar symmetry cancels the three B–F dipoles; NH3’s trigonal pyramidal asymmetry leaves a net dipole pointing from the H atoms toward nitrogen.

## 9.4 Covalent Bonding and Orbital Overlap
### Key ideas
- In valence-bond theory, covalent bonds form when atomic orbitals overlap and share electron density between nuclei; this overlap stabilizes the molecule.
- σ (sigma) bonds result from head-on overlap along the internuclear axis, while π (pi) bonds come from sideways overlap of p orbitals above and below that axis.
- Bond length corresponds to the internuclear distance at the minimum of the potential-energy curve, balancing attractive and repulsive forces; the potential energy decreases with overlap until nuclear repulsion pushes it back up.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **σ vs π bond structure**: A single bond consists of one σ bond; a double bond adds one π bond (σ + π), and a triple bond adds two π bonds (σ + 2π). Each π bond layers electron density above/below the axis. This classification helps students count the total overlapping regions and understand rotational restriction.

### Short example(s)
- **H2 formation**: Two 1s orbitals overlap head-on to form a σ bond with a bond length of 74 pm; the potential-energy minimum at that distance represents the strongest stability before repulsion rises.
- **Cl2 and HCl**: Cl–Cl uses p–p overlap to make a σ bond; H–Cl uses s–p overlap—each overlap concentrates electron density between atoms.

## 9.5 Hybrid Orbitals
### Key ideas
- Hybrid orbitals reconcile atomic orbital shapes with molecular geometries by mixing s and p orbitals: sp, sp2, and sp3 hybrids point in directions matching the VSEPR-predicted electron-domain geometries.
- Each atomic orbital used in hybridization yields one hybrid orbital; the hybrids are equivalent in energy and point along the directions of bonding or lone pairs.
- Hybridization applies best when the central atom has an octet or fewer electrons; hypervalent molecules (Period 3+) do not rely on s–p mixing because the needed d orbitals sit too high in energy.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Hybridization-geometry table** (Table 9.4): Mixing s + p gives sp (linear, 180°); s + 2p gives sp2 (trigonal planar, 120°); s + 3p gives sp3 (tetrahedral, 109.5°). The table matches the number of orbitals mixed to how many electron domains they can host.
- **Hybridization assignment steps**: 1) Draw the Lewis structure, 2) use VSEPR to get electron-domain geometry, 3) map that geometry to the appropriate hybrid set. This method makes hybridization a predictive tool tied to shape.

### Short example(s)
- **BeF2**: The Be atom mixes 2s + 2p → two sp hybrids pointing opposite each other, giving two identical Be–F bonds and a linear shape.
- **BF3**: Boron’s 2s + two 2p orbitals form three sp2 hybrids in a plane at 120°, matching its trigonal planar shape and leaving one unused 2p perpendicular to the plane.
- **CH4/NH3/H2O**: Carbon’s sp3 hybrids create four equivalent bonds to hydrogens, and nitrogen/oxygen use sp3 hybrids to hold lone pairs plus bonds (NH3’s lone pair compresses angles to ~107°, while H2O compresses to ~104.5°).

## 9.6 Multiple Bonds
### Key ideas
- Double and triple bonds result from combining σ bonds (head-on overlap of hybrids) with one or two π bonds (sideways overlap of unhybridized p orbitals); π bonds require planarity and restrict rotation.
- π electrons can delocalize over several atoms when resonance structures exist, giving rise to equalized bond lengths and extra stability (e.g., benzene, NO3−).
- Delocalized π systems demand coplanar atoms for effective overlap; these systems also influence color and reactivity in conjugated molecules.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Multiple bond architecture**: Double bond = σ + π; triple bond = σ + 2π. σ bonds are localized between two atoms, while each π bond adds lobes above/below the bond axis, creating regions of density that can delocalize.

### Short example(s)
- **Ethene (C2H4)**: Each carbon uses sp2 hybrids to form σ bonds (C–C and C–H), leaving one unhybridized p orbital per carbon to overlap sideways and form the C=C π bond; all atoms lie in the same plane.
- **Ethyne (C2H2)**: sp-hybridized carbons form the σ framework, and two unhybridized p orbitals on each carbon overlap to give two π bonds, creating a rigid, linear triple bond.
- **Benzene & NO3−**: Both exhibit delocalized six-electron π systems spread evenly over ring or trigonal planar frameworks, making all C–C or N–O bonds identical in length and strength.

## 9.7 Molecular Orbitals
### Key ideas
- Molecular orbital (MO) theory builds bonding and antibonding orbitals from combinations of atomic orbitals; bonding orbitals are lower in energy due to constructive interference, while antibonding orbitals are higher because of destructive interference (nodal planes).
- Filling MOs with electrons (two per orbital) creates an electron configuration for the molecule; the stability depends on how many electrons sit in bonding vs antibonding orbitals.
- Bond order quantifies this stability: higher bond orders generally correspond to stronger, shorter bonds, and MO theory applies even to odd-electron species.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Bond order formula** (Eq. 9.1): `Bond order = ½ (number of bonding electrons − number of antibonding electrons)`. The unit is “bonding pairs” (no physical unit) and tells students how many bonds, on average, hold the atoms together after considering destabilizing antibonding electrons.

### Short example(s)
- **H2**: Two electrons occupy the σ(1s) bonding MO and none the σ*(1s) antibonding MO, so bond order = ½ (2 − 0) = 1; the molecule is stable with a single bond.
- **He2**: Both σ and σ* orbitals are filled, so bond order = ½ (2 − 2) = 0; He2 does not exist because bonding and antibonding cancel.
- **He2+**: Three electrons occupy σ and σ*, giving bond order = ½ (2 − 1) = ½; the ion exists and is marginally stable because bonding remains greater than antibonding.

## 9.8 Bonding in Period 2 Diatomic Molecules
### Key ideas
- Period 2 diatomic molecules combine 2s and 2p atomic orbitals to make σ and π MOs; the ordering of sσ, pπ, and sπ levels shifts between B2/C2/N2 (where σ2p is higher) and O2/F2/Ne2 (where σ2p drops below π2p).
- The five MO-formation rules remind us that (1) the number of MOs equals the number of atomic orbitals, (2) orbitals mix best with similar energies, (3) greater overlap increases bonding–antibonding splitting, (4) each MO holds two electrons, and (5) Hund’s rule governs degenerate MOs.
- Bond order from MO diagrams predicts experimental facts: higher bond orders → shorter, stronger bonds; unpaired electrons → paramagnetism (e.g., O2); and the absence of a bond (order 0) explains why Ne2 doesn’t exist.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **MO energy ordering with 2s–2p mixing**: Interactions between 2s and 2p orbitals push σ2s lower and σ2p higher; the relative energy of σ2p vs π2p defines the order in B2/C2/N2 vs O2/F2/Ne2. This shift tells students why, for example, B2 has unpaired electrons while O2 remains paramagnetic even with a bond order of 2.

### Short example(s)
- **MO configurations**: B2 has σ2s2 σ*2s2 π2p1 π2p1 (bond order 1, paramagnetic); N2 ends with π2p2 π2p2 σ2p2 (bond order 3, diamagnetic). O2 fills π*2p orbitals with two unpaired electrons, giving bond order 2 but paramagnetism.
- **NO molecule**: Heteronuclear mixing lowers the MO energies from the more electronegative O atom, tilting the MO contributions; filling 11 electrons yields bond order 2½ and one unpaired electron, matching its partial radical character and experimental bond length (115 pm).
- **O2+ ion**: Removing one electron from O2’s π*2p orbitals leaves a bond order of 2½ and only one unpaired electron, predicting a shorter, stronger, yet still paramagnetic diatomic cation.
