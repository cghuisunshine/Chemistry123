      <h2>10.1 Characteristics of Gases</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Gases consist of widely spaced molecules that behave similarly even when composed of very different species because the molecules rarely interact.</li>
        <li>A gas expands to fill its container, is highly compressible, and any mixture of gases is homogeneous because the particles occupy only about 0.1% of the volume—they act independently.</li>
        <li>Vapors are gaseous forms of substances that are liquids or solids under ordinary conditions.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Volume equals container volume:</strong> Any gas fills the space available, so the macroscopic volume of the gas equals the vessel that holds it; this is why gases expand spontaneously and why their densities are low.</li>
        <li><strong>Homogeneous mixing:</strong> Because intermolecular distances are large, the partial volume occupied by each gas is negligible and different gases form one uniform phase.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Air is almost all N₂ and O₂ yet behaves as a single gaseous material for pressure and volume measurements even though O₂ supports life and N₂ does not.</p>

      <h2>10.2 Pressure</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Gas pressure arises from molecular impacts on container walls; pressure measures how many collisions occur and how forceful they are.</li>
        <li>Atmospheric pressure results from the weight of a ~10,000 kg column of air above each square meter, and instruments such as barometers and manometers compare gas pressure with that benchmark.</li>
        <li>Standard atmospheric pressure is 1 atm ≈ 760 mm Hg ≈ 101.3 kPa, and medical and industrial gauges convert between units (Pa, bar, atm, psi).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pressure definition,</strong> <code>P = F/A</code> (Equation 10.1): Pressure is force per unit area; increasing force (more collisions) or reducing area raises pressure, so compressing a gas or heating it increases P.</li>
        <li><strong>Hydrostatic pressure in a fluid column,</strong> <code>P = ρ g h</code>: Gives the extra pressure from a liquid column and is used in barometers, diver problems, and manometers.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>A diver 31.0 m below water experiences total pressure <code>~398 kPa</code> by adding atmospheric pressure (98 kPa) and water pressure (~300 kPa) (Sample Exercise 10.1).</p>
      <p>A mercury manometer with 136.4 mm vs 103.8 mm column heights shows the sample gas pressure is 797.3 torr because the gas pushes mercury into the arm open to air (Sample Exercise 10.2).</p>

      <h2>10.3 The Gas Laws</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Boyle’s law relates pressure and volume at constant temperature: squeezing a gas halves its volume if the pressure doubles.</li>
        <li>Charles’s law links volume and absolute temperature at constant pressure: heating a balloon raises T in kelvins and causes its volume to rise proportionally.</li>
        <li>Avogadro’s law ties volume to amount (moles); doubling the moles at fixed P and T doubles the volume, so equal volumes of gases at the same conditions contain the same number of molecules.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Boyle’s law:</strong> <code>P₁V₁ = P₂V₂</code> at constant n and T (Equation 10.7), expressing pressure inverse to volume because fewer gallons of space concentrate collisions.</li>
        <li><strong>Charles’s law:</strong> <code>V₁/T₁ = V₂/T₂</code> at constant n and P (Equation 10.3), showing volume tracks absolute temperature directly.</li>
        <li><strong>Avogadro’s law:</strong> <code>V ∝ n</code> at constant P and T (Equation 10.4); thus reaction volumes follow mole ratios (e.g., 2 L H₂ + 1 L O₂ → 2 L H₂O vapor).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Letting a weather balloon rise demonstrates Boyle’s law: decreasing atmospheric pressure lets the balloon expand dramatically (Figure 10.5).</p>
      <p>Injecting gas into a sealed cylinder at constant T and V raises pressure since more moles occupy the same space (Sample Exercise 10.3).</p>

      <h2>10.4 The Ideal Gas Equation</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The ideal gas equation <code>PV = nRT</code> combines Boyle’s, Charles’s, and Avogadro’s laws via the gas constant R.</li>
        <li>Deviations from ideal behavior are small at moderate pressures but become important above ~1 MPa.</li>
        <li>Rearranging the law yields density and molar-mass expressions, and the combined gas law <code>P₁V₁/T₁ = P₂V₂/T₂</code> handles simultaneous changes in P, V, and T.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ideal gas law:</strong> <code>PV = nRT</code> (Equation 10.5), where T is in kelvins, n in moles, and R chosen to match pressure and volume units.</li>
        <li><strong>Density form:</strong> <code>d = PM/RT</code> (Equation 10.10) gives density directly, and rearranging to <code>M = dRT/P</code> (Equation 10.11) determines molar mass.</li>
        <li><strong>Combined gas law:</strong> <code>P₁V₁/T₁ = P₂V₂/T₂</code> (Equation 10.8) keeps n constant while P, V, and T change together.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>CO₂ collected at 131.72 kPa and 31 °C in a 250 mL flask yields <code>n ≈ 0.013 mol</code> using <code>n = PV/RT</code> (Sample Exercise 10.4).</p>
      <p>A 144 cm³ tennis ball containing 0.33 g of N₂ at 24 °C has a pressure found by converting mass to moles, plugging into <code>PV = nRT</code>, and solving for P.</p>

      <h2>10.5 Gas Mixtures and Partial Pressures</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Dalton’s law says total pressure equals the sum of partial pressures each component would exert alone (Equation 10.12).</li>
        <li>Mole fraction <code>Xᵢ = nᵢ/n_total</code> links the proportion of each gas to its pressure via <code>Pᵢ = Xᵢ · P_total</code> (Equation 10.16).</li>
        <li>Adding more gas increases the total pressure because each species contributes proportionally to its mole share.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dalton’s law:</strong> <code>P_total = Σ Pᵢ</code> (Equation 10.12), implying each gas behaves independently.</li>
        <li><strong>Mole fraction relation:</strong> <code>Pᵢ = Xᵢ P_total</code> with <code>Xᵢ = nᵢ/n_total</code> (Equations 10.14–10.16).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>A vessel with 6.00 g O₂ and 9.00 g CH₄ at 15.0 L and 0 °C has <code>P_total ≈ 113.64 kPa</code> because <code>P_O₂ ≈ 28.45 kPa</code> and <code>P_CH₄ ≈ 85.19 kPa</code> (Sample Exercise 10.10).</p>
      <p>In a controlled atmosphere (1.5% CO₂, 18.0% O₂, 80.5% Ar) at 99.33 kPa, the O₂ partial pressure is <code>0.18 × 99.33 ≈ 17.88 kPa</code>, giving <code>n = PV/RT ≈ 0.882 mol</code> (Sample Exercise 10.11).</p>

      <h2>10.6 The Kinetic-Molecular Theory of Gases</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The theory assumes random motion, negligible molecular volume and forces, and that average molecular kinetic energy is proportional to temperature.</li>
        <li>Pressure is explained by collisions with container walls, and raising temperature increases rms molecular speeds (u_rms, u_avg, u_mp).</li>
        <li>The macroscopic gas laws emerge naturally: increasing volume at constant T lowers pressure because collisions are less frequent, and increasing temperature at constant volume raises pressure because collisions are more forceful.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Average kinetic energy:</strong> <code>KE_avg = ½ m u_rms²</code> with <code>u_rms ∝ √T</code>, showing molecular motion grows with temperature (Equation 10.20).</li>
        <li><strong>Ideal gas derivation:</strong> Pressure ∝ nT/V leads to <code>PV = nRT</code> when including the constant R (Equation 10.19), linking kinetic theory to the ideal gas law.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Compressing O₂ at constant temperature increases collision frequency and pressure while keeping average kinetic energy and speed constant (Sample Exercise 10.12).</p>
      <p>Rising temperature shifts the Maxwell distribution so more molecules exceed 500 m/s, increasing the most probable and rms speeds (Figure 10.13).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>10.7 Molecular Effusion and Diffusion</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Effusion is the escape of gas through a tiny hole; diffusion is the spread of molecules through a volume.</li>
        <li>Graham’s law relates effusion rates to molar mass: lighter gases effuse faster because they move with higher rms speed (<code>r ∝ u_rms ∝ 1/√M</code>).</li>
        <li>Collisions shorten the mean free path, so diffusion rates are much slower than single-molecule speeds despite frequent motion.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Graham’s law:</strong> <code>r₁/r₂ = √(M₂/M₁)</code> (Equation 10.22), so doubling molar mass roughly reduces the effusion rate by 1/√2.</li>
        <li><strong>Root-mean-square speed:</strong> <code>u_rms = √(3RT/M)</code> (Equation 10.20), so lighter molecules have greater speeds and thus effuse faster.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Helium-filled balloons lose gas more quickly than argon-filled ones because helium effuses faster through microscopic pores (Figure 10.16).</p>
      <p>An unknown diatomic gas effusing at 0.355 times the rate of O₂ has molar mass ≈ 254 g/mol, so it must be I₂ (Sample Exercise 10.14).</p>
    </section>

      <h2>10.8 Real Gases: Deviations from Ideal Behavior</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Real gases deviate from <code>PV = nRT</code> because molecules occupy volume (excluded volume) and attract one another; deviations grow at high pressure and low temperature.</li>
        <li>Plotting <code>PV/RT</code> vs pressure shows values near 1 at low P but differing from 1 as pressure rises; cooling blows up attraction effects.</li>
        <li>The van der Waals equation introduces constants <strong>a</strong> (attractive forces) and <strong>b</strong> (molecular volume) to correct pressure and volume and better match real gases.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Deviation indicator:</strong> <code>PV/RT</code> should equal 1 for an ideal gas (Equation 10.24); values lower than 1 signal attractions, while values above 1 signal significant molecular size.</li>
        <li><strong>van der Waals equation:</strong> <code>(P + a n²/V²)(V − n b) = nRT</code> (Equation 10.25); the <code>a</code> term raises pressure to offset attractions, and the <code>b</code> term shrinks volume to reflect finite molecular size.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Ten moles of Cl₂ in 22.41 L at 0 °C exert 908.9 kPa via van der Waals corrections, below the ideal 1.013 MPa because intermolecular attractions reduce pressure more than excluded volume raises it (Sample Exercise 10.15).</p>
      <p>Cooling nitrogen to 200 K increases the negative deviation of <code>PV/RT</code>, while heating to 1000 K diminishes the deviation, showing thermal energy overcomes attractions (Figure 10.21).</p>
