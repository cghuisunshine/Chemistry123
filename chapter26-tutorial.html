      <h2>26.1 The Structure of Unsaturated Hydrocarbons</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Alkenes (CnH2n) and alkynes (CnH2n−2) contain C=C or C≡C p bonds that are weaker than sigma bonds and prevent free rotation, making them more reactive than alkanes.</li>
        <li>Sideways overlap of p orbitals above/below the internuclear axis forms the p bond; the electron density is absent on the axis.</li>
        <li>Unsaturated small molecules (e.g., ethene, acetylene, isoprene) serve as monomers for polymers and appear in natural products such as terpenes.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Alkene formula:</strong> `CnH2n`. Each CH₂ unit adds two hydrogens while maintaining a double bond.</li>
        <li><strong>Alkyne formula:</strong> `CnH2n−2`. Triple bonds further remove two hydrogens compared to the corresponding alkene.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Ethene drives plant responses and polymerization; acetylene burns in oxyacetylene torches at ~3200 K.</p>

      <h2>26.2 Isomerism and Nomenclature</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Geometric (E/Z) isomers arise because p bonds lock the substituents relative to each other; cis/trans descriptors depend on substituent priority (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog).</li>
        <li>Alkene names indicate the position of the double bond; cycloalkenes share the formula CnH2n with alkynes but differ in connectivity.</li>
        <li>Terpenes (e.g., limonene, menthol, carotene) are built from linked isoprene units, showing biological use of unsaturation.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Naming rule:</strong> Number the longest chain containing the unsaturation so the double/triple bond gets the lowest locant, and end with `-ene` or `-yne` (e.g., pent-1-ene, pent-2-yne).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>2-ethyl-3-methylpent-1-ene places the double bond at carbon 1 and uses substituent prefixes to indicate ethyl at C3 and methyl at C2.</p>

      <h2>26.3 Arrow Notation and Resonance Structures</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Curved arrows show electron flow in mechanisms: from bonds/lone pairs to atoms or bonds; fishhook arrows illustrate single-electron movement (radicals).</li>
        <li>Resonance structures (e.g., nitromethane, formate) illustrate electron delocalization; the actual molecule is a hybrid, stabilizing charge.
        </li>
        <li>Nucleophiles donate electron pairs, electrophiles accept them; arrow notation maps these steps in additions or substitutions.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>General electrophilic addition:</strong> `Nu:` + `E⁺` → `Nu–E`. A nucleophile attacks an electrophile to form a new bond, often via a carbocation.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>In nitromethane/resonance, a curved arrow moves a lone pair on one oxygen to form an N=O bond while shifting the other N=O electrons into a lone pair.</p>

      <h2>26.4 Electrophilic Addition Reactions</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Alkenes undergo electrophilic addition: halogenation, hydrohalogenation, hydration, and halohydrin formation all proceed via carbocation intermediates.
        </li>
        <li>Carbocation stability (3° > 2° > 1°) and Markovnikov’s rule dictate regioselectivity (electrophile to least substituted carbon).
        </li>
        <li>Bromination proceeds via bromonium ions, giving anti addition; halohydrins form when Br₂ and H₂O add across the double bond with OH replacing one halogen.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Markovnikov’s rule:</strong> `HX` addition: `H` attaches to the carbon with more hydrogens; the halogen ends up on the more substituted carbon because that carbocation is more stable.</li>
        <li><strong>Rate law:</strong> `Rate = k[alkene][HX]` because the slow step involves both reagents forming the carbocation.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>1-methylcyclohexene reacting with HCl gives 1-chloro-1-methylcyclohexane via a tertiary carbocation; bromination of cyclohexene yields trans-dibromocyclohexane due to the bromonium intermediate.</p>

      <h2>26.5 Catalytic Hydrogenation</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>H₂ adds across C=C or C≡C bonds with metal catalysts (Pt, Pd, Ni) in heterogeneous hydrogenation; surface adsorption lowers activation energy.</li>
        <li>The catalyst adsorbs H₂ and alkene, breaks the H–H bond, and delivers atoms sequentially to the carbons before releasing the saturated alkane.</li>
        <li>Hydrogenation turns liquid vegetable oils into solid fats (margarine) by saturating double bonds, raising melting points because straight chains pack more tightly.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hydrogenation example:</strong> `C₂H₄ + H₂ → C₂H₆` (ΔH ≈ −137 kJ/mol) with Pt lowering the activation barrier by adsorbing reactants.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>3-methyl-1-pentene hydrogenates to 3-methylpentane; Pd/C yields cis-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane from the corresponding cyclohexene.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>26.6 Addition Polymerization</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Addition (chain-growth) polymerization links alkene monomers via radicals (initiation, propagation, termination) to form high-molecular-weight polymers such as polyethylene.</li>
        <li>Initiators (e.g., peroxides) generate radicals; propagation adds monomers, and termination occurs when two radicals combine.</li>
        <li>Polymer properties (density, stiffness) depend on molecular weight, branching (LDPE vs. HDPE), crystallinity, plasticizers, and cross-linking (vulcanized rubber, Teflon® discovery).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Polymer repeat unit:</strong> `n CH₂=CH₂ → (−CH₂−CH₂−)ₙ`. Each monomer adds via its double bond, forming saturates chains.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Polymer stages:</strong> Initiation (radical formation), propagation (radical adds monomers), termination (radical combination). Radical stability follows `3° > 2° > 1°`.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Polyethylene forms as LDPE (branched, low crystallinity) or HDPE (linear, high crystallinity) depending on conditions; ethene polymerization via Ziegler–Natta catalysts gives HDPE used in bottles.</p>
