# Chapter 24 Tutorial — The Chemistry of Organic Compounds

## 24.1 General Characteristics of Organic Molecules
### Key ideas
- Carbon has four valence electrons, so it forms up to four covalent bonds (sp³, sp², sp hybridization) and creates the backbone of organic molecules; hydrogen always sits on the perimeter because it can form only one bond.
- Carbon–carbon single bonds and C–H bonds are strong and nonpolar, which makes hydrocarbons relatively inert; functional groups (C–O, O–H, halides, etc.) are the reactive centers.
- Many organic molecules (methane, ethanol, etc.) are built from a hydrocarbon framework decorated with functional groups, so organic reactivity derives from those groups while the hydrocarbon portion provides stability.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **General hydrocarbon backbone:** `CnH2n+2` for alkanes. Every additional methylene (`–CH₂–`) unit adds two hydrogens, so n carbon atoms give 2n + 2 hydrogens, describing saturated straight-chain alkanes.
- **Functional group notation:** `R–H` (alkanes) versus `R–OH` (alcohols). The symbol R represents the carbon skeleton and highlights that reactivity often occurs at the functional group attached to R.

### Short example(s)
- Ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) reacts through its polar C–O and O–H bonds while the CH₃CH₂– group remains inert, showing how the functional group controls chemistry.

## 24.2 An Introduction to Hydrocarbons
### Key ideas
- Hydrocarbons contain only C and H; alkanes (saturated), alkenes (one or more C=C), alkynes (C≡C), and aromatic rings make up the four classes.
- Homologous series (straight-chain n-alkanes) share the formula pattern CnH2n+2 and show smooth trends in physical properties (b.p., m.p.) with increasing molecular mass.
- Dispersion forces increase with chain length, so light alkanes are gases, medium ones liquids (gasoline), and long ones solids (waxes, paraffins).

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Alkane general formula:** `CnH2n+2`. For n = 1 → CH₄, 2 → C₂H₆, 3 → C₃H₈, etc., capturing the series where each added CH₂ raises the hydrogen count by two.

### Short example(s)
- The first ten straight-chain alkanes (methane through decane) all end in `-ane`; pentane (`C₅H₁₂`) is an example of a liquid used in fuels.

## 24.3 Structures of Alkanes
### Key ideas
- Carbon atoms in alkanes are sp³ hybridized and tetrahedral (109.5° bond angles); sigma bonds form by head-on overlap of hybridized orbitals.
- Straight-chain alkanes are called normal (n-alkanes); constitutional isomers appear when the carbon skeleton branches.
- Conformations arise from rotation about C–C single bonds; staggered conformers are lower in energy than eclipsed ones, as seen in ethane and butane.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Conformational energy difference:** staggered < eclipsed because torsional strain arises when electrons in adjacent bonds align; therefore, molecules adopt staggered arrangements to minimize energy.

### Short example(s)
- The three-dimensional chair conformation of cyclohexane avoids angle strain (109.5°) and dominates over the higher-energy boat form by ~30 kJ/mol.

## 24.4 Alkane Nomenclature
### Key ideas
- Name alkanes by identifying the longest carbon chain, numbering it to give substituents the lowest possible locants, and alphabetizing substituent names (methyl, ethyl, etc.); use prefixes (di-, tri-, tetra-) for multiples.
- Each substituent (alkyl) is named by replacing `-ane` with `-yl` (e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl).
- Numbering direction ensures smallest numbers overall; e.g., 3,4-dimethylheptane uses the longest chain of seven carbons.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Naming rule summary:** `prefix + substituent + parent + (oxidation/position)`. Example: `3,4-dimethylheptane` identifies two methyl groups on carbons 3 and 4 of a seven-carbon chain.

### Short example(s)
- `3-ethyl-2-methylpentane` is built from pentane with an ethyl on C3 and a methyl on C2; the condensed formula `CH₃CH(CH₃)CH(CH₂CH₃)CH₂CH₃` shows the substituent positions.

## 24.5 Cycloalkanes
### Key ideas
- Cycloalkanes are rings of carbon atoms with formula `CnH2n` (loss of two hydrogens compared to alkanes) since they have one C–C bond more than the open chain.
- Small rings (three or four carbons) have angle strain, while cyclohexane avoids it by adopting the chair conformation with alternating axial/equatorial hydrogens.
- Substituents prefer the equatorial positions to minimize 1,3-diaxial steric strain (e.g., methylcyclohexane favors the equatorial methyl).

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Cycloalkane formula:** `CnH2n`. Each cycloalkane has two fewer hydrogens than the corresponding open-chain alkane because closing the ring removes a C–H bond and creates a C–C bond.

### Short example(s)
- Cyclohexane has chair and boat conformers; the chair form is more stable because it avoids eclipsing and minimizes axial interactions (e.g., 1,3-diaxial clashes if a methyl is axial).

## 24.6 Organic Functional Groups
### Key ideas
- Functional groups (alkyl, hydroxyl, carbonyl, halide, amine, etc.) dictate reactivity; functionalized hydrocarbons react at the functional group while the carbon skeleton remains intact.
- Heteroatoms such as O and N introduce polarity; oxygen-containing groups (alcohols, ethers, carbonyls) undergo characteristic transformations.
- The general placeholder R denotes the alkyl portion of a molecule that stabilizes the molecule but is not reactive in a given transformation.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Functional group shorthand:** `R–OH` (alcohol), `R–NH₂` (amine), `R–COOH` (carboxylic acid). R represents the hydrocarbon portion; the functional group controls reactions.

### Short example(s)
- Morphine, heroin, methadone, and naloxone share key functional groups (alcohols, amines, esters) that modulate solubility and receptor binding.

## 24.7 Reactions of Alkanes
### Key ideas
- Alkanes are relatively unreactive due to strong, nonpolar C–H and C–C bonds, but they do undergo combustion and free-radical halogenation, especially under heat or light.
- In radical halogenation, initiation (Cl₂ → 2 Cl·), propagation (Cl· abstracts H, generating R·, then R· reacts with Cl₂), and termination (radical recombination) steps define the mechanism.
- Secondary and tertiary hydrogens are more readily abstracted than primary ones because the resulting radicals are more stable and have lower C–H bond dissociation energies.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Combustion:** `CnH2n+2 + (3n+1)/2 O₂ → n CO₂ + (n+1) H₂O` (balanced). Alkane combustion is highly exothermic (e.g., `2 C₂H₆ + 7 O₂ → 4 CO₂ + 6 H₂O`).
- **Radical halogenation selectivity:** `1°:2°:3° ≈ 1:4:5` for chlorine and `1:100:1500` for bromine due to differences in C–H bond strength and radical stability.

### Short example(s)
- Chlorinating propane yields primarily 1-chloropropane (primary H abundant) but also 2-chloropropane; the secondary radical is more stable, so bromination strongly favors the 2° product.
