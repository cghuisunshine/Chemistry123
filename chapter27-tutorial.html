    <section>
      <h2>27.1 Alcohols: Structure, Properties, and Nomenclature</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Alcohols contain OH groups; the oxygen is sp³ hybridized with two lone pairs, enabling hydrogen bonding that raises boiling points and water solubility.</li>
        <li>As the alkyl tail grows, the molecule behaves more like a hydrocarbon, reducing water solubility but increasing nonpolar solvent compatibility.</li>
        <li>Names derive from the longest chain containing the OH; consider stereochemistry if chiral centers exist.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hydrogen bonding:</strong> OH–O attractions (~20 kJ/mol) keep alcohols cohesive and miscible with water.</li>
        <li><strong>Solubility trend:</strong> Ethanol is miscible with water, whereas heptanol is only slightly soluble because the hydrophobic portion dominates.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Glycerol, with three OH groups, dissolves in water easily, while cholesterol (one OH) is waxy and largely immiscible.</p>

      <h2>27.2 Haloalkanes</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Haloalkanes replace an H with X (Cl, Br, I) and serve as electrophilic substrates for substitution or elimination.</li>
        <li>Carbon-halogen bond strengths decrease down the group; iodides are easiest to substitute because I⁻ is the best leaving group.
        </li>
        <li>Haloalkanes arise from alcohols (via acid or SOCl₂/PCl₃) or by addition to alkenes.
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Alcohol to haloalkane:</strong> `R–OH + HBr → R–Br + H₂O` (SN1 for tertiary alcohols with carbocation), or `ROH + SOCl₂ → R–Cl + SO₂ + HCl` for primary alcohols.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>2-Methyl-2-propanol reacts with HBr to give 2-bromo-2-methylpropane because the tertiary carbocation forms readily.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>27.3 Ethers: Structure, Properties, and Nomenclature</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Ethers (`R–O–R'`) have lower boiling points than alcohols because they cannot hydrogen bond as donors; they are good polar aprotic solvents.</li>
        <li>Names list the alkyl groups alphabetically followed by `ether` (common) or `alkoxy-alkane` (systematic); cyclic ethers like THF or 1,4-dioxane use heterocyclic nomenclature.
        </li>
        <li>Crown ethers (e.g., 18-crown-6) and macrocyclic compounds (nonactin) encapsulate metal ions and serve in supramolecular chemistry.
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ether bond angles:</strong> The O in R–O–R′ uses sp³ orbitals to form sigma bonds; lone pairs maintain bond angles ~110°.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Diethyl ether (`CH₃CH₂OCH₂CH₃`) boils at 35 °C and is more volatile than butanol; 18-crown-6 solubilizes K⁺ in organic solution.</p>

      <h2>27.4 Reactions of Alcohols</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Alcohols deprotonate to form alkoxides (`RO⁻`), which are strong bases/nucleophiles used in substitution or elimination.</li>
        <li>Acid protonates OH to form oxonium ions; dehydration or substitution occurs via carbocations.</li>
        <li>Functional group interconversion (alcohol → alkene, haloalkane, ether, carbonyl) stems from manipulating the OH site.
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Alkoxide formation:</strong> `2 ROH + 2 Na → 2 RONa + H₂`.</li>
        <li><strong>Carbocation precursor:</strong> `R–OH + H⁺ → R–OH₂⁺ → R⁺ + H₂O` (oxygen leaves as water, making carbocation).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Sodium metal reacts with ethanol to give sodium ethoxide and H₂; 2-methyl-2-propanol forms a tertiary carbocation that can eliminate to 2-methylpropene or substitute to give 2-bromo-2-methylpropane.</p>

      <h2>27.5 Nucleophilic Substitution of Haloalkanes</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>SN1 reactions proceed via carbocations (`Rate ~ [R–X]`); SN2 involves concerted attack/inversion (`Rate ~ [R–X][Nu⁻]`).</li>
        <li>Strong nucleophiles and polar aprotic solvents favor SN2; tertiary substrates often follow SN1/E1 due to stable carbocations.
        </li>
        <li>Halide leaving groups order: I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻; better leaving groups speed substitution.
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>SN2 inversion:</strong> `R–Br + CN⁻ → R–CN + Br⁻` occurs with backside attack, flipping stereochemistry.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Secondary bromides can undergo SN1 under acidic heat or SN2 with strong nucleophiles; tertiary halides favor SN1 due to carbocations.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>27.6 β-Elimination to Alkenes</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>β-Elimination (E2/E1) removes HX from adjacent carbons; bases abstract β-H, forming alkenes.</li>
        <li>E2 requires anti-periplanar H and halogen; strong bases favor E2, while tertiary substrates with weak base/nucleophile may go via E1.
        </li>
        <li>E/Z geometry arises because of restricted rotation around the C=C bond formed.
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>E2 rate law:</strong> `Rate = k[R–X][Base]`. Concerted transition state removes β-H as leaving group departs.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>2-bromobutane with t-BuOK (bulky base) yields trans-but-2-ene (E2) rather than substitution.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>27.7 Substitution versus Elimination</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Temperature, base strength, solvent, and substrate control whether substitution or elimination dominates.</li>
        <li>Bulky bases and high temperature favor elimination (E2); good nucleophiles in polar aprotic solvents favor SN2.
        </li>
        <li>Tertiary haloalkanes with weak nucleophiles favor SN1/E1 due to stable carbocations, while primary ones prefer SN2.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pathway trends:</strong> `strong bulky base → E2`, `strong nucleophile weak base → SN2`, `weak nucleophile/heat → SN1/E1`.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Heating 2-bromobutane with t-BuOK yields but-2-ene (elim), while NaN₃ in DMSO gives substitution to 2-azidobutane.</p>
