# Chapter 23 Tutorial — Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry

## 23.1 The Transition Metals
### Key ideas
- Transition metals have partially filled d orbitals, which give rise to multiple accessible oxidation states, colorful salts, and catalytic activity.
- Period 5 and 6 transition metals share similar radii and chemical behavior because of the lanthanide contraction.
- Magnetic ordering (paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, antiferromagnetic) depends on how unpaired d-electron spins align; above the Curie (T<sub>C</sub>) or Néel (T<sub>N</sub>) temperatures these materials become paramagnetic.

### Important formulas &amp; their meaning
- **Charge and unpaired-electron counting:** The charge of a transition-metal ion (and hence its number of d electrons) determines whether a substance is paramagnetic (unpaired electrons) or diamagnetic (all electrons paired); experimental magnetic measurements therefore reveal the number of unpaired d electrons.
- **Magnetic ordering thresholds:** T<sub>C</sub> and T<sub>N</sub> mark the temperatures above which ferromagnetic/ferrimagnetic or antiferromagnetic order, respectively, collapses into paramagnetism because thermal energy overcomes the spin-aligning interactions.

### Short example(s)
- Iron, cobalt, and nickel are the only pure transition metals that are ferromagnetic at room temperature (their spin alignment produces a permanent magnet until the Curie point is exceeded).

## 23.2 Transition-Metal Complexes
### Key ideas
- Coordination compounds consist of a metal ion surrounded by ligands (Lewis bases) that donate electron pairs.
- The coordination number is the number of ligands directly bonded to the metal; 4 and 6 are most common, giving tetrahedral, square-planar, or octahedral geometries.
- Formation of a complex can change both the observed color and redox behavior of the metal because ligand fields stabilize particular oxidation states.

### Important formulas &amp; their meaning
- **Complex charge:** `q_complex = q_metal + Σ q_ligand`. For example, in [Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺ the neutral NH₃ ligands leave the Cu charge (+2) as the complex charge.
- **Formation constant:** `K_f = [complex]/([metal][ligand]^n)`. The much larger K_f for Ni(en)₃²⁺ relative to Ni(NH₃)₆²⁺ illustrates the chelate effect; chelating (multidentate) ligands sequester the metal more strongly.

### Short example(s)
- [Rh(NH₃)₅Cl](NO₃)₂ has Rh in the +3 state because the single Cl ligand contributes −1 and each NO₃⁻ counterion contributes −1, so the complex cation must be 2⁺ to balance the two nitrates.

## 23.3 Common Ligands in Coordination Chemistry
### Key ideas
- Ligands have donor atoms that bind to the metal: monodentate ligands use one donor, bidentate and polydentate (chelating) ligands wrap around the metal with multiple donor atoms.
- Chelating agents form much more stable complexes than their monodentate counterparts; this is the chelate effect, which arises because chelation releases additional solvent molecules (entropy) and forms more bonds.
- Biologically important chelates include porphyrins that hold Fe(II) in heme and Mg(II) in chlorophyll, enabling oxygen transport and photosynthesis.

### Important formulas &amp; their meaning
- **Chelate effect illustration:** For Ni²⁺, `K_f(Ni(en)₃²⁺) ≈ 6.8 × 10¹⁷` is orders of magnitude larger than `K_f(Ni(NH₃)₆²⁺) ≈ 1.2 × 10⁹`, because one en ligand displaces two monodentate NH₃ ligands and liberates more solvent molecules.

### Short example(s)
- Na₂Ca(EDTA) is administered for lead poisoning because EDTA chelates Pb²⁺ tightly, keeping it soluble so it can be excreted rather than deposited in tissues.

## 23.4 Nomenclature and Isomerism in Coordination Chemistry
### Key ideas
- Coordination compounds are named by listing ligands alphabetically (prefixes notwithstanding), stating the metal with its oxidation state, and indicating anionic complexes with the suffix `-ate`.
- Constitutional isomers include linkage isomers (e.g., nitro vs. nitrito) and coordination-sphere isomers that differ in which species are inside the coordination sphere.
- Stereoisomers arise from ligand arrangements around the metal: geometric (cis/trans) and optical (enantiomers) isomers have distinct physical/biological behavior.

### Important formulas &amp; their meaning
- **Naming order:** `cation name before anion name`; within a coordination sphere: `numbered ligands → metal (oxidation state)`. Example: `[Co(NH₃)₅Cl]Cl₂` is pentaamminechloridocobalt(III) chloride because five neutral ammines and one chlorido ligand precede the metal and `Cl₂` sits outside.

### Short example(s)
- The anticancer drug cisplatin is cis-[Pt(NH₃)₂Cl₂]; its trans isomer lacks activity because the chloride ligands are too far apart to form the chelate with DNA nitrogens that disrupt cell replication.

## 23.5 Color and Magnetism in Coordination Chemistry
### Key ideas
- A complex appears the color complementary to the wavelengths it absorbs; the absorption spectrum indicates which transitions are active.
- Paramagnetism arises when d electrons remain unpaired; diamagnetic complexes have all electrons paired and will not be attracted to magnetic fields.
- Ligand identity alters both color and magnetism because different ligands change the splitting of d orbitals and the number of unpaired electrons.

### Important formulas &amp; their meaning
- **Photon energy and color:** `E = hc/λ`. Visible absorption at a given wavelength (λ) corresponds to energy promotion (e.g., 680 nm → red absorption, so complex appears green).

### Short example(s)
- trans-[Co(NH₃)₄Cl₂]²⁺ absorbs red light (~680 nm), so we observe its complementary green color; the cis isomer absorbs yellow and looks violet.

## 23.6 Crystal-Field Theory
### Key ideas
- Ligands create an electrostatic field that splits the metal d orbitals into lower-energy and higher-energy sets (t₂/e for octahedral; reversed for tetrahedral).
- The splitting energy, Δ, determines whether electrons pair (low-spin) or occupy higher orbitals (high-spin); strong-field ligands (CN⁻, en) produce large Δ, while weak-field ligands (F⁻, H₂O) produce small Δ.
- The spectrochemical series ranks ligands by their ability to increase Δ so that replacing H₂O with CN⁻ shifts absorption to shorter wavelengths and can convert a paramagnetic high-spin complex into a diamagnetic low-spin one.

### Important formulas &amp; their meaning
- **Δ and high/low spin:** When Δ > spin-pairing energy, electrons pair in the lower t₂ orbitals → low-spin complex; when Δ < pairing energy, electrons occupy higher e orbitals before pairing → high-spin complex.
- **Photon energy and Δ:** `Δ = hc/λ_max`. For example, the absorption maximum for Ti(H₂O)₆³⁺ near 500 nm provides the splitting energy that defines its purple color.

### Short example(s)
- [Co(CN)₆]³⁻ is a low-spin d⁶ complex (low paramagnetism) because the strong-field CN⁻ ligand makes Δ larger than the spin-pairing energy; [CoF₆]³⁻ has four unpaired electrons because weak-field F⁻ gives a smaller Δ.
