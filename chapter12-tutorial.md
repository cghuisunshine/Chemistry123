# Chapter 12 Tutorial — Solids and Modern Materials

## 12.1 Classification of Solids
### Key ideas
- Solids are classified by predominant bonding: metallic (delocalized electrons), ionic (cations/anions), covalent-network (extended covalent) and molecular (intermolecular forces), with polymers and nanomaterials forming hybrid classes.
- Crystalline solids have repeating unit cells and lattice point scaffolds, while amorphous solids lack long-range order.
- Seven primitive 3D lattices (triclinic, monoclinic, orthorhombic, tetragonal, rhombohedral, hexagonal, cubic) plus centered variants (body- or face-centered) describe how unit cells tile space.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Crystal density formula:** `ρ = (n·M)/(N_A·V_cell)` relates macroscopic density to the number of formula units `n` per cell, molar mass `M`, Avogadro’s number `N_A`, and cell volume `V_cell`. It lets you check whether a proposed structure matches experimental density.
- **Bragg’s law (qualitative form):** `nλ = 2d sin θ` explains how X-ray diffraction reveals lattice spacings `d`; constructive interference occurs when the path difference equals an integer multiple of the X-ray wavelength `λ`, allowing structural determination.

### Short example(s)
- The NaCl structure stacks cube-shaped unit cells with ions at the corners and face centers, giving a face-centered cubic lattice and `ρ ≈ 2.16 g/cm³` when plugged into the density formula.

## 12.2 Metallic Solids
### Key ideas
- Metallic bonding consists of an array of positive ions immersed in a sea of delocalized valence electrons, yielding conductivity, malleability, and ductility.
- Close-packed lattices (primarily face-centered cubic (FCC) and hexagonal close-packed (HCP)) maximize packing efficiency and are common in metals; body-centered cubic (BCC) appears in elements like iron.
- Band theory explains metallic behavior: bands formed by overlapping orbitals are partially filled, enabling electrons to move freely under an electric field.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Packing efficiency:** FCC and HCP pack spheres at ~74% efficiency, leaving 26% void space, which relates directly to the high density and cohesive energy of close-packed metals.
- **Metallic conductivity (qualitative):** Conductivity `σ ∝ n_e·μ` depends on the density of delocalized electrons `n_e` and their mobility `μ`, highlighting the role of the electron sea.

### Short example(s)
- Copper crystallizes in an FCC lattice with atoms at each corner and face center, allowing electrons to drift freely and conduct electricity in wiring.

## 12.3 Ionic Solids
### Key ideas
- Ionic solids form from electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions, producing rigid, brittle crystals with high melting points and poor electrical conductivity in the solid state.
- Each ion’s coordination number depends on the relative radii; common structures include NaCl (6:6) and CsCl (8:8).
- Lattice energy (the energy released when gaseous ions form a crystal) governs stability and melting behavior.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Lattice energy (Born–Landé style):** `U ∝ (|q⁺q⁻|)/(r⁺ + r⁻)`; higher charges and smaller ionic radii increase the electrostatic term, raising melting points and hardness.
- **Molar mass and density for ionic solids** derived from unit-cell contents (same as Section 12.1) confirm structural assignments (e.g., NaCl’s `n=4` formula units per cell).

### Short example(s)
- NaCl forms an FCC lattice with Cl⁻ at face centers and Na⁺ on corners; the 6:6 coordination and large lattice energy (∼-787 kJ/mol) explain its high melting point (801 °C).

## 12.4 Covalent Solids
### Key ideas
- Covalent-network solids consist of atoms linked by directional covalent bonds throughout the crystal, yielding extremely hard materials with high melting points (e.g., diamond, quartz, SiC).
- Bond directionality limits electrical conductivity (unless doped) and makes these materials brittle because bond breaking requires large energy.
- The motif may not coincide with lattice points; e.g., diamond’s motif contains two tetrahedrally bonded carbon atoms per primitive cell.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Bond strength relation:** The energy to break a covalent bond (~400 kJ/mol) is much larger than typical intermolecular forces, explaining the large heats of fusion/vaporization for diamond and silica.
- **Coordination number effect:** For diamond, each carbon has four neighbors in a tetrahedral motif; the resulting rigid 3D network causes high melting (∼3500 °C).

### Short example(s)
- Diamond is a cubic lattice where each carbon forms four σ bonds; the resulting network is exceptionally hard and transparent, reflecting the strong directional bonding.

## 12.5 Polymers
### Key ideas
- Polymers are long-chain macromolecules made of repeating monomer units connected by covalent bonds; their mechanical properties blend covalent backbone strength with intermolecular forces between chains.
- Chain entanglement and cross-linking increase viscosity, tensile strength, and melting temperature.
- Thermoplastics soften upon heating (chains slide), while thermosets (cross-linked) cannot be remelted.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Degree of polymerization:** `n = M_polymer / M_monomer`, expressing the average number of repeat units; higher `n` raises molecular weight, viscosity, and mechanical strength.
- **Glass transition concept:** Temperature `T_g` marks where an amorphous polymer transitions from rigid to rubbery, corresponding to increased chain mobility and decreased viscosity.

### Short example(s)
- Polyethylene (−CH₂−CH₂−)ₙ has long flexible chains; increasing chain length raises its melting point and tensile strength, which is why HDPE is used for sturdy containers.

## 12.6 Nanomaterials
### Key ideas
- Nanomaterials have one or more dimensions in the 1–100 nm range, so a large fraction of atoms lie at surfaces, dramatically altering melting points, reactivity, and optical/electronic behavior.
- Quantum confinement in nanoparticles (e.g., quantum dots) raises the bandgap energy as size decreases, tuning color/emission.
- Surface-area-to-volume ratio increases inversely with size, enhancing catalysis and mechanical interactions.

### Important formulas & their meaning
- **Surface-area-to-volume ratio:** `SA/V ∝ 1/r` for spherical particles; halving the radius doubles the proportion of surface atoms, explaining why catalytic activity skyrockets for nanoparticles.
- **Quantum confinement energy:** For a particle in a box model, `E ∝ h²/(2m r²)` shows the bandgap increases as particle size `r` decreases, shifting absorption/emission to shorter wavelengths.

### Short example(s)
- TiO₂ nanoparticles appear white in bulk but ultraviolet-active when downsized, making them effective in sunscreens and photocatalysis because more surface atoms interact with light.
