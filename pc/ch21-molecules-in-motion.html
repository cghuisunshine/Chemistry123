    <h1>Chapter 21 Tutorial — Molecules in motion</h1>
    <p>Molecules in motion 21 One of the simplest types of molecular motion to describe is the random motion of Molecular motion in gases molecules of a perfect gas. We see that a simple theory accounts for the pressure of a gas and the rates at which molecules and energy migrate through gases.</p>

      <h2>21.1 The kinetic model of gases</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The kinetic model is based on three assumptions: 1 The gas consists of molecules of mass m in ceaseless random motion.</li>
        <li>2 The size of the molecules is negligible, in the sense that their diameters are much smaller than the average distance travelled between collisions.</li>
        <li>An elastic collision is a collision in which the total translational kinetic energy of the molecules is conserved.</li>
        <li>The x-component of momentum therefore changes by Fig.</li>
        <li>21.1 The pressure of a gas arises from 2mvx on each collision (the y- and z-components are unchanged).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>21.2 Collisions With Walls And Surfaces</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>we have to realize that the state of matter is that of a plasma, in which the electrons have been stripped from the atoms of hydrogen and helium that make up the bulk of the matter of stars.</li>
        <li>Therefore, a mean free path of only 0.1 pm satisﬁes the criterion for the validity of the kinetic theory and the perfect gas law.</li>
        <li>We can therefore use pV = nRT as the equation of state for the stellar interior.</li>
        <li>As for any perfect gas, the pressure in the interior of the Sun is related to the mass density, ρ = m/V, by p = ρRT/M.</li>
        <li>Half way to the centre of the Sun, the temperature is 3.6 MK and the mass density is 1.20 g cm−3 (slightly denser than water); so the pressure there works out as 7.2 × 1013 Pa, or about 720 million atmospheres.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas & their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>law. We can therefore use pV = nRT as the equation of state for the stellar interior.</code>. An equation of state connects the measurable state variables of a gas; changing one variable forces at least one other to change.</li>

      <h2>21.3 The rate of effusion</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The essential empirical observations on eﬀusion are summarized by Graham’s law of eﬀusion, which states that the rate of eﬀusion is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass.</li>
        <li>The basis of this result is that, as remarked above, the mean speed of molecules is inversely proportional to M1/2, so the rate at which they strike the area of the hole is also inversely proportional to M1/2.</li>
        <li>When a gas at a pressure p and temperature T is separated from a vacuum by a small hole, the rate of escape of its molecules is equal to the rate at which they strike the area of the hole (which is given by eqn 21.14).</li>
        <li>Therefore, for a hole of area A0, pA0 pA0 NA Rate of eﬀusion = ZW A = 1/2 = (21.16)° (2πmkT) (2πMRT)1/2 where, in the last step, we have used R = NAk and M = mNA.</li>
        <li>This rate is inversely pro- portional to M1/2, in accord with Graham’s law.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>21.4 Transport Properties Of A Perfect Gas</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>where A0 is the area of the hole and m is the mass of one atom.</li>
        <li>Experimental observations on transport properties show that the ﬂux of a property is usually proportional to the ﬁrst derivative of some other related property.</li>
        <li>The SI units of J are number per metre squared per second (m−2 s−1).</li>
        <li>There is no net ﬂux if the concentration is uniform (dN /dz J 0 = 0).</li>
        <li>Similarly, the rate of thermal conduction (the ﬂux of the energy associated with thermal motion) is found to be proportional to the temperature gradient: Fig.</li>

        <li>The motion of molecules in liquids can be studied experimentally by a variety of * More values are given in the Data section.</li>
        <li>Another important technique is inelastic neutron scattering, in which the energy neutrons collect or discard as they pass through a sample is inter- 2.0 preted in terms of the motion of its particles.</li>
        <li>The same technique is used to examine the internal dynamics of macromolecules.</li>
        <li>More mundane than these experiments are viscosity measurements (Table 21.4).</li>
        <li>The probability that a molecule has at least an energy Ea is 103 hh/(kg m-1 s-1) proportional to e−Ea /RT, so the mobility of the molecules in the liquid should follow 1.2 this type of temperature dependence.</li>

      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>(a) Conductance and conductivity The fundamental measurement used to study the motion of ions is that of the electrical resistance, R, of the solution.</li>
        <li>The conductance, G, of a solution is the inverse of its 762 21 MOLECULES IN MOTION resistance R: G = 1/R.</li>
        <li>As resistance is expressed in ohms, Ω, the conductance of a sample is expressed in Ω−1.</li>
        <li>The reciprocal ohm used to be called the mho, but its oﬃcial designation is now the siemens, S, and 1 S = 1 Ω−1 = 1 C V−1 s−1.</li>
        <li>We therefore write κA G= (21.27) l where κ is the conductivity.</li>

      <h2>21.7 The mobilities of ions</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The central idea in this section is that, although the motion of an ion remains largely random, the presence of an electric ﬁeld biases its motion, and the ion undergoes net migration through the solution.</li>
        <li>However, this acceleration is short-lived.</li>
        <li>The net force is zero when zeE s= (21.41) f It follows that the drift speed of an ion is proportional to the strength of the applied ﬁeld.</li>
        <li>We write s = uE [21.42] where u is called the mobility of the ion (Table 21.6).</li>
        <li>This value means that, when there is a potential diﬀerence of 1 V across a solution of length 1 cm (so E = 100 V m−1), the drift speed is typically about 5 µm s−1.</li>

      <h2>21.8 Conductivities And Ion–Ion Interactions</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>There is a sharp boundary between the two solutions.</li>
        <li>When a current I is passed for a time ∆t, the boundary moves from AB to CD, so all the M ions in the volume between AB and CD must have passed through CD.</li>
        <li>That number is clANA, so the charge that the M ions transfer through the plane is z+clAeNA.</li>
        <li>However, the total charge transferred when a current I ﬂows for an interval ∆t is I∆t.</li>

        <li>The graph shows 10 1 s 1 ms 1 s 1 h1 d1 y that diﬀusion is a very slow process (which is why solutions are stirred, to encourage mixing by convection).</li>
        <li>21.28 The root mean square distance covered by particles with D = 5 × An intuitive picture of diﬀusion is of the particles moving in a series of small steps and 10−10 m2 s−1.</li>
        <li>The total dis- tance travelled by a particle in a time t is therefore tλ /τ.</li>
        <li>The net distance travelled after N steps is equal to the diﬀerence between the number of steps to the right (NR) and to the left (NL), and is (NR − NL)λ.</li>
