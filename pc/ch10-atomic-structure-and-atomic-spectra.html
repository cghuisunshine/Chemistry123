    <h1>Chapter 10 Tutorial — Atomic structure and atomic spectra</h1>
    <p>10 Atomic structure and atomic spectra The structure and spectra of We now use the principles of quantum mechanics introduced in the preceding two chap- hydrogenic atoms ters to describe the internal structures of atoms. We see what experimental information is available from a study of the spectrum of atomic hydrogen.</p>
    <section>
      <h2>10.1 The Structure Of Hydrogenic Atoms</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Both the observed spectrum and its resolution into overlapping series are shown.</li>
        <li>Because spectroscopic observations show that electromagnetic radiation is absorbed and emitted by atoms only at certain wavenumbers, it follows that only certain energy states of atoms are permitted.</li>
        <li>Our tasks in the ﬁrst part of this chapter are to deter- mine the origin of this energy quantization, to ﬁnd the permitted energy levels, and to account for the value of RH.</li>
        <li>The quantity µ is called the reduced mass.</li>
        <li>The reduced mass is very sim- ilar to the electron mass because mN, the mass of the nucleus, is much larger than the mass of an electron, so 1/µ ≈ 1/me.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas & their meaning</h3>

      <h2>10.2 Atomic orbitals and their energies</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>An atomic orbital is a one-electron wavefunction for an electron in an atom.</li>
        <li>Each hydrogenic atomic orbital is deﬁned by three quantum numbers, designated n, l, and Energy of widely separated stationary ml.</li>
        <li>When an electron is described by one of these wavefunctions, we say that it electron and nucleus ‘occupies’ that orbital.</li>
        <li>We could go on to say that the electron is in the state |n,l,ml .</li>
        <li>For instance, an electron described by the wavefunction ψ1,0,0 and in the state |1,0,0 Continuum is said to occupy the orbital with n = 1, l = 0, and ml = 0.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas & their meaning</h3>

      <h2>10.3 Spectroscopic transitions and selection rules</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The energies of the hydrogenic atoms are given by eqn 10.11.</li>
        <li>It is tempting to think that all possible transitions are permissible, and that a spec- trum arises from the transition of an electron from any initial orbital to any other orbital.</li>
        <li>However, this is not so, because a photon has an intrinsic spin angular momentum corresponding to s = 1 (Section 9.8).</li>
        <li>It follows that some spectroscopic transitions are allowed, meaning that they can occur, whereas others are forbidden, meaning that they cannot occur.</li>
        <li>A selection rule is a statement about which transitions are allowed.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas & their meaning</h3>

      <h2>10.4 The orbital approximation</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The wavefunction of a many-electron atom is a very complicated function of the coordinates of all the electrons, and we should write it ψ (r1,r2, .</li>
        <li>), where ri is the vector from the nucleus to electron i.</li>
        <li>However, in the orbital approximation we sup- pose that a reasonable ﬁrst approximation to this exact wavefunction is obtained by thinking of each electron as occupying its ‘own’ orbital, and write ψ (r1,r2, .</li>
        <li>This description is only approximate, but it is a useful model for discussing the chemical properties of atoms, and is the starting point for more sophisticated descriptions of atomic structure.</li>
        <li>This is the result we need to prove.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas & their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>ψ (r1,r2, . . . ) = ψ (r1)ψ (r2) . . . (10.29)</code>. This relation links the quantities shown; treat it as a compact statement of how changing one variable constrains the others.</li>
        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>@ = @1 + @2</code>. This relation links the quantities shown; treat it as a compact statement of how changing one variable constrains the others.</li>
        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>function of @2 with energy E2, then the product ψ (r1,r2) = ψ (r1)ψ (r2) is an eigen-</code>. This relation links the quantities shown; treat it as a compact statement of how changing one variable constrains the others.</li>
        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>@ψ (r1,r2) = (@1 + @2)ψ (r1)ψ (r2) = @1ψ (r1)ψ (r2) + ψ (r1)@2ψ (r2)</code>. This relation links the quantities shown; treat it as a compact statement of how changing one variable constrains the others.</li>
        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>= E1ψ (r1)ψ (r2) + ψ (r1)E2ψ (r2) = (E1 + E2)ψ (r1)ψ (r2)</code>. This relation links the quantities shown; treat it as a compact statement of how changing one variable constrains the others.</li>
        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>= Eψ (r1,r2)</code>. This relation links the quantities shown; treat it as a compact statement of how changing one variable constrains the others.</li>

      <h2>10.5 Self-consistent ﬁeld orbitals</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The central diﬃculty of the Schrödinger equation is the presence of the electron– electron interaction terms.</li>
        <li>The ﬁrst term is the total attractive interaction between the electrons and the nucleus.</li>
        <li>The second term is the total repulsive interaction between the electrons; rij is the distance between electrons i and j.</li>
        <li>In broad outline, the Hartree–Fock self- consistent ﬁeld (HF-SCF) procedure is as follows.</li>
        <li>A Schrödinger equation can be written for this electron by ascribing to it a potential energy due to the nuclear attraction and the repulsion from the other elec- trons.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas & their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>V=− ∑ 4πε r + –12 ∑ (10.37)</code>. This relation links the quantities shown; treat it as a compact statement of how changing one variable constrains the others.</li>
        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>− V(exchange correction)ψ2p(1) = E2pψ2p(1) (10.38)</code>. This relation links the quantities shown; treat it as a compact statement of how changing one variable constrains the others.</li>
        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>with a change of energy |∆E|, and emits or absorbs a photon of frequency ν = |∆E |/h</code>. This relation links the quantities shown; treat it as a compact statement of how changing one variable constrains the others.</li>
        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>and # = |∆E |/hc. Hence, we can expect the spectrum to give information about the</code>. This relation links the quantities shown; treat it as a compact statement of how changing one variable constrains the others.</li>

      <h2>10.6 Quantum defects and ionization limits</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>One application of atomic spectroscopy is to the determination of ionization energies.</li>
        <li>However, we cannot use the procedure illustrated in Example 10.1 indiscriminately</li>

      <h2>10.7 Singlet And Triplet States</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Typical values of Zeﬀ are a little more than 1, so we expect binding energies to be given by a term of the form −hcR/n2, but lying slightly lower in energy than this formula predicts.</li>
        <li>We therefore introduce a quantum defect, δ, and write the energy as −hcR/(n − δ )2.</li>
        <li>The quantum defect is best regarded as a purely empirical quantity.</li>
        <li>There are some excited states that are so diﬀuse that the 1/n2 variation is valid: these states are called Rydberg states.</li>
        <li>We know that the ground-state conﬁguration is 1s2, and can anticipate that an excited ms   -12 conﬁguration will be one in which one of the electrons has been promoted into a 2s orbital, giving the conﬁguration 1s12s1.</li>
