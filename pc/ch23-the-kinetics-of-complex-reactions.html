    <h1>Chapter 23 Tutorial — The kinetics of complex reactions</h1>
    <p>23 The kinetics of complex reactions Chain reactions This chapter extends the material introduced in Chapter 22 by showing how to deal with complex reaction mechanisms. First, we consider chain reactions and see that either com- plicated or simple rate laws can be obtained, depending on the conditions.</p>
    <section>
      <h2>23.1 The Rate Laws Of Chain Reactions</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The chain carriers ·CH3 and ·CHO are formed initially in the initiation step.</li>
        <li>To test the proposed mechanism we need to show that it leads to the observed rate law.</li>
        <li>In many cases, a chain reaction leads to a complicated rate law.</li>
        <li>An example is the hydrogen–bromine reaction: d[HBr] k[H2][Br2]3/2 HBr H2(g) + Br2(g) → 2 HBr(g) = (23.4) dt [Br2] + k′[HBr] Propagation The following mechanism has been proposed to account for this rate law (Fig.</li>
        <li>23.1): Br2 Initiation: Br2 + M → Br· + Br· + M v = k i[Br2][M] Initiation Br2 where M is either Br2 or H2.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas & their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>= k i[CH3CHO] − k p[·CH3][CH3CHO] + k′p[CH3CO·] − 2k t[·CH3]2 = 0</code>. This relation links the quantities shown; treat it as a compact statement of how changing one variable constrains the others.</li>
        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>= k p[·CH3][CH3CHO] − k′p[CH3CO·] = 0</code>. This relation links the quantities shown; treat it as a compact statement of how changing one variable constrains the others.</li>
        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>ki[CH3CHO] − 2k t[·CH3]2 = 0</code>. This relation links the quantities shown; treat it as a compact statement of how changing one variable constrains the others.</li>
        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>[·CH3] = [CH3CHO]1/2 (23.2)</code>. This relation links the quantities shown; treat it as a compact statement of how changing one variable constrains the others.</li>
        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>= kp[·CH3][CH3CHO] = k p [CH3CHO]3/2 (23.3)</code>. This relation links the quantities shown; treat it as a compact statement of how changing one variable constrains the others.</li>
        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>H2(g) + Br2(g) → 2 HBr(g) = (23.4)</code>. This relation links the quantities shown; treat it as a compact statement of how changing one variable constrains the others.</li>

      <h2>23.2 Explosions</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A thermal explosion is a very rapid reaction arising from a rapid increase of reaction rate with increasing temperature.</li>
        <li>An example of both types of explosion is the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen: 2 H2(g) + O2(g) → 2 H2O(g) Although the net reaction is very simple, the mechanism is very complex and has not yet been fully elucidated.</li>
        <li>A chain reaction is involved, and the chain carriers include H·, ·O·, and ·OH.</li>
        <li>The same is true of an O2 molecule, with 12 valence electrons and a ground-state conﬁguration 1σ g21σ u2 2σ g21π 4u1π g2.</li>
        <li>The occurrence of an explosion depends on the temperature and pressure of the system, and the explosion regions for the reaction, the conditions under which explosion occurs, are shown in Fig.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas & their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>Initiation: H2 → H· + H· v = constant (vinit)</code>. This relation links the quantities shown; treat it as a compact statement of how changing one variable constrains the others.</li>
        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>Propagation: H2 + ·OH → ·H + H2O v = k p[H2][·OH]</code>. This relation links the quantities shown; treat it as a compact statement of how changing one variable constrains the others.</li>

        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>Termination: H· + wall → –12 H2 v = k t[H·]</code>. This relation links the quantities shown; treat it as a compact statement of how changing one variable constrains the others.</li>
        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>H· + O2 + M → HO2· + M* v = k′t[H·][O2][M]</code>. This relation links the quantities shown; treat it as a compact statement of how changing one variable constrains the others.</li>

      <h2>23.3 Stepwise Polymerization</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Polymerization kinetics In stepwise polymerization any two monomers present in the reaction mixture can link together at any time and growth of the polymer is not conﬁned to chains that are already forming (Fig.</li>
        <li>As a result, monomers are removed early in the reaction and, as we shall see, the average molar mass of the product grows with time.</li>
        <li>The monomer is used up as it becomes linked to the growing chains (Fig.</li>
        <li>High polymers are formed rapidly and only the yield, not the average molar mass, of the polymer is increased by allowing long reaction times.</li>
        <li>23.3 Stepwise polymerization Stepwise polymerization commonly proceeds by a condensation reaction, in which a small molecule (typically H2O) is eliminated in each step.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas & their meaning</h3>

      </ul>

      <h2>23.4 Chain polymerization</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>We have shown a reaction in which a radical is produced, but in some polymeriza- tions the initiation step leads to the formation of an ionic chain carrier.</li>
        <li>The rate- determining step is the formation of the radicals R· by homolysis of the initiator, so the rate of initiation is equal to the vi given above.</li>
        <li>Consequently, for suﬃciently large chains, the rate of propagation is equal to the overall rate of polymerization.</li>
        <li>Because this chain of reactions propagates quickly, the rate at which the total con- centration of radicals grows is equal to the rate of the rate-determining initiation step.</li>
        <li>It follows that A d[·M] D B E = 2fki[I] (23.10) C dt F production where f is the fraction of radicals R· that successfully initiate a chain.</li>

      <h2>23.5 Features Of Homogeneous Catalysis</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Homogeneous catalysis Ea(uncatalysed) A catalyst is a substance that accelerates a reaction but undergoes no net chemical Potential energy change.</li>
        <li>Catalysts can be very eﬀective; for instance, the activation energy for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in solution is 76 kJ mol−1, and the reaction is slow at room temperature.</li>
        <li>When a little iodide ion is added, the activation energy falls to 57 kJ mol−1 and the rate constant increases by a factor of 2000.</li>
        <li>Enzymes, which are biological catalysts, are very speciﬁc and can have a dramatic eﬀect on the reactions Products they control.</li>
        <li>A homogeneous catalyst is a catalyst in the same phase as the reaction mixture.</li>
