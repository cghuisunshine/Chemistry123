# Chapter 24 Tutorial — Molecular reaction dynamics

Molecular reaction dynamics 24 The simplest quantitative account of reaction rates is in terms of collision theory, which can Reactive encounters be used only for the discussion of reactions between simple species in the gas phase.

## 24.1 Collision theory

### Key ideas
- Reactions in solution are classiﬁed into two types: diffusion-controlled and activation- controlled.
- The former can be expressed quantitatively in terms of the diffusion equation.
- In 24.2 Diffusion-controlled reactions transition state theory, it is assumed that the reactant molecules form a complex that can be discussed in terms of the population of its energy levels.
- Transition state theory inspires 24.3 The material balance a thermodynamic approach to reaction rates, in which the rate constant is expressed in equation terms of thermodynamic parameters.
- This approach is useful for parametrizing the rates Transition state theory of reactions in solution.

## 24.2 Diffusion-controlled reactions

### Key ideas
- Reactant molecules have to jostle their way through the solvent, so their encounter frequency is considerably less than in a gas.
- This linger- ing of one molecule near another on account of the hindering presence of solvent molecules is called the cage eﬀect.
- This expression solves to kd[A][B] [AB] = (24.22) ka + k′d The rate of formation of products is therefore d[P] kakd ≈ ka[AB] = k2[A][B] k2 = (24.23) dt ka + k′d Two limits can now be distinguished.
- kakd k2 ≈ = kd (24.24) ka In this diﬀusion-controlled limit, the rate of reaction is governed by the rate at which the reactant molecules diﬀuse through the solvent.
- An indication that a reaction is diﬀusion-controlled is that its rate constant is of the order of 109 dm3 mol−1 s−1 or greater.

## 24.9 The investigation of reaction dynamics with ultrafast

### Key ideas
- The frequency of the second pulse is set at an absorption of one of the free fragmentation products, so its absorption is a measure of the abundance of the dissociation product.
- A short laser pulse is composed of a wide range of frequencies, which excite many vibrational Na  I states of NaI simultaneously.
- However, not every outward-going swing leads to dissociation because there is a chance that the I atom can be harpooned again, in which case it fails to make good its escape.

## 24.10 The rates of electron transfer processes

### Key ideas
- Next, electron transfer occurs within the DA complex to yield D+A−: DA → D+A− vet = ket[DA] (24.76b) where ket is the ﬁrst-order rate constant for the forward electron transfer step.
- It follows that 1 1 A k′a D ≈ 1+ kobs ka C ket F When ket >> k′a, we see that kobs ≈ ka and the rate of product formation is controlled by diﬀusion of D and A in solution, which fosters formation of the DA complex.
- When ket << k′a, we see that kobs ≈ (ka /k′a )ket or, after using eqn 24.76a, kobs ≈ KDAket (24.78) and the process is controlled by the activation energy of electron transfer in the DA complex.

## 24.11 Theory of electron transfer processes

### Key ideas
- Dogonadze: DA 1 Electrons are transferred by tunnelling through a potential energy barrier, the  DA  height of which is partly determined by the ionization energies of the DA and D+A− Gibbs energy complexes.
- Therefore, electron transfer can occur only after thermal ﬂuc- parabolas occur, respectively.
- Initially, the elec-  DA  tron to be transferred occupies the HOMO of D, and the overall energy of DA is lower than that of D+A− (Fig.
- Over reasonably short distances r, the main mechanism of elec- tron transfer is tunnelling through the potential energy barrier depicted in Fig.
- As shown in the illustration, now the energy of D+A− is lower than that of DA, reﬂecting the thermo- V Energy dynamic tendency for A to remain reduced and for D to remain oxidized.

## 24.12 Experimental results

### Key ideas
- It is diﬃcult to measure the distance dependence of ket when the reactants are ions or molecules that are free to move in solution.
- In such cases, electron transfer occurs after a donor–acceptor complex forms and it is not possible to exert control over r, the edge-to-edge distance.
- The value of β depends on the medium through which the electron must travel from donor to acceptor.
- In a vacuum, 28 nm−1 < β < 35 nm−1, whereas β ≈ 9 nm−1 when the intervening medium is a molecular link between donor and acceptor.
- The dependence of ket on the standard reaction Gibbs energy has been investigated in systems where the edge-to-edge distance, the reorganization energy, and κν are constant for a series of reactions.
