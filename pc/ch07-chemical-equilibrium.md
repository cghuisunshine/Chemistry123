# Chapter 7 Tutorial — Chemical equilibrium

7 Chemical equilibrium Spontaneous chemical This chapter develops the concept of chemical potential and shows how it is used to reactions account for the equilibrium composition of chemical reactions. The equilibrium composition corresponds to a minimum in the Gibbs energy plotted against the extent of reaction, and by locating this minimum we establish the relation between the equilibrium constant enables us to establish the quantitative effects of changes in the conditions.

## 7.1 The Gibbs Energy Minimum

### Key ideas
- Even though this reaction looks trivial, there are many examples of it, such as the isomerization of pentane to 2-methylbutane and the conversion of l-alanine to d-alanine.
- Suppose an inﬁnitesimal amount dξ of A turns into B, then the change in the amount of A present is dnA = −dξ and the change in the amount of B present is dnB = +dξ.
- The quantity ξ (xi) is called the extent of reaction; it has the dimensions of amount of substance and is reported in moles.
- So, if initially 2.0 mol A is present and we wait until ∆ξ = +1.5 mol, then the amount of A remaining will be 0.5 mol.
- However, to see that there is a close relationship with the normal usage, suppose the reaction advances by dξ.

## 7.2 The Description Of Equilibrium

### Key ideas
- Hence, an important mixing contribution to the position of chemical equilibrium is the mixing of the products with the reactants as the products are formed.
- There is no intermediate minimum in the graph.
- We have seen that the contribution of a mixing process to the change in products is ignored, then the Gibbs energy Gibbs energy is given by eqn 5.27 (∆mixG = nRT(xA ln xA + xB ln xB)).
- As can be reactants) to its ﬁnal value (pure products) and the slope of the line is ∆rG 7.

## 7.3 How equilibria respond to pressure

### Key ideas
- The equilibrium constant depends on the value of ∆rG 7, which is deﬁned at a single, standard pressure.
- The value of ∆rG 7, and hence of K, is therefore independent of the pressure at which the equilibrium is actually established.
- It follows that pressurization by the addition of an inert gas has no eﬀect on the equilibrium composition of the system (provided the gases are perfect).
- Alternatively, the pressure of the system may be increased by conﬁning the gases to a smaller volume (that is, by compression).
- Now the individual partial pressures are changed but their ratio (as it appears in the equilibrium constant) remains the same.

## 7.4 The Response Of Equilibria To Temperature

### Key ideas
- To treat the eﬀect of compression quantitatively, we suppose that there is an 1.0 amount n of A present initially (and no B).
- At equilibrium the amount of A is (1 − α)n and the amount of B is 2αn, where α is the extent of dissociation of A into 2B.
- 7.7 The pressure dependence of the This formula shows that, even though K is independent of pressure, the amounts of degree of dissociation, α, at equilibrium for A and B do depend on pressure (Fig.
- It also shows that as p is increased, α an A(g) 5 2 B(g) reaction for diﬀerent decreases, in accord with Le Chatelier’s principle.
- Therefore, doubling the pressure must increase Kx by a factor of 4 to preserve the value of K.

## 7.5 Half-reactions and electrodes

### Key ideas
- The electron transfer may be accompanied by other events, such as atom or ion transfer, but the net eﬀect is electron transfer and hence a change in oxidation number of an element.
- The reducing agent (or ‘reductant’) is the electron donor; the oxidizing agent (or ‘oxidant’) is the electron acceptor.
- It should also be familiar that any redox reaction may be expressed as the diﬀerence of two reduction half- reactions, which are conceptual reactions showing the gain of electrons.
- Even reac- tions that are not redox reactions may often be expressed as the diﬀerence of two reduction half-reactions.
- The reduced and oxidized species in a half-reaction form a redox couple.

## 7.6 Varieties Of Cells

### Key ideas
- This quotient is deﬁned like the reaction quotient for the overall reaction, but the electrons are ignored.
- The electrode at which oxidation occurs is called the anode; the electrode at which reduction occurs is called the cathode.
- 7.11 When a spontaneous reaction potential than the anode: the species undergoing reduction, Ox2, withdraws electrons takes place in a galvanic cell, electrons are from its electrode (the cathode, Fig.
- cathode), and so there is a net ﬂow of current which can be used to do work.
- In some cases it is necessary to immerse the electrodes in diﬀerent electrolytes, leave the cell.

- Then we subtract from it the left-hand reduction half-reaction (for, by implication, that 7.7 THE ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE 219 electrode is the site of oxidation).
- The work that a given transfer of electrons can accomplish depends on the potential diﬀerence between the two electrodes.

## 7.8 Standard potentials

### Key ideas
- A galvanic cell is a combination of two electrodes, and each one can be considered as making a characteristic contribution to the overall cell potential.
- Although it is not possible to measure the contribution of a single electrode, we can deﬁne the potential of one of the electrodes as zero and then assign values to others on that basis.
- The spe- cially selected electrode is the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE): Pt(s) | H2(g) | H+(aq) E7 = 0 [7.31] at all temperatures.
- To achieve the standard conditions, the activity of the hydrogen ions must be 1 (that is, pH = 0) and the pressure (more precisely, the fugacity) of the hydrogen gas must be 1 bar.
- The standard potential, E 7, of another couple is then assigned by constructing a cell in which it is the right-hand electrode and the standard hydrogen electrode is the left-hand electrode.

- In practice the standard values of these quantities are the ones normally determined.
- The quantitative value of K is obtained by doing the calculations * The complete series can be inferred from we have described previously.
- How- ever, even for reactions that are thermodynamically favourable, there may be kinetic factors that result in very slow rates of reaction.
- The reactions of the electron transport chains of respiration are good applications of this principle.
