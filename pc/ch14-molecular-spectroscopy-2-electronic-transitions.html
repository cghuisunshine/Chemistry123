      <h2>14.2 The Electronic Spectra Of Polyatomic Molecules</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>We therefore see P, Q, and R branches for each vibrational transition, and the electronic transition has a very rich structure.</li>
        <li>We suppose that the rotational constants of the electronic ground and excited states are B and B′, respectively.</li>
        <li>(a) The formation of a head in the R branch when B′ < B; (b) the formation of a is negative.</li>
        <li>J is such that |B′ − B|(J + 1) > B′ + B the lines start to appear at successively decreasing wavenumbers.</li>
        <li>That is, the R branch has a band head (Fig.</li>

      <h3>Important formulas & their meaning</h3>

        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>P branch (∆J = −1): #P(J) = # − (B′ + B)J + (B′ − B)J 2 (14.5a)</code>. This relation links the quantities shown; treat it as a compact statement of how changing one variable constrains the others.</li>
        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>Q branch (∆J = 0): #Q(J) = # + (B′ − B)J(J + 1) (14.5b) Fig. 14.11 When the rotational constants of</code>. This relation links the quantities shown; treat it as a compact statement of how changing one variable constrains the others.</li>
        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>R branch (∆J = +1): #R(J) = # + (B′ + B)(J + 1) + (B′ − B)(J + 1)2</code>. This relation links the quantities shown; treat it as a compact statement of how changing one variable constrains the others.</li>

      <h2>14.3 Fluorescence and phosphorescence</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Fluorescence In ﬂuorescence, spontaneous emission of radiation occurs within a few nanoseconds after the exciting radiation is extinguished (Fig.</li>
        <li>The diﬀerence suggests that ﬂuorescence is a fast conversion of absorbed radiation into re-emitted energy, and that phosphorescence Fig.</li>
        <li>A radiative transition lower state; it is also displaced to lower then occurs from the vibrational ground frequencies (but the 0–0 transitions are state of the upper electronic state.</li>
        <li>It might therefore survive long enough to Relaxation undergo spontaneous emission, and emit the remaining excess energy as radiation.</li>
        <li>The mechanism also suggests that the intensity of and that arrangement is preserved during the ﬂuorescence ought to depend on the ability of the solvent molecules to accept the the subsequent radiative transition.</li>

      <h2>14.4 Dissociation And Predissociation</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>With proper ﬁltering to remove light due to Rayleigh scattering of the incident beam, it is possible to collect light from the sample that contains only ﬂuorescence from the label.</li>
        <li>However, great care is required to eliminate ﬂuorescent impurities from the sample.</li>
        <li>14.4 Dissociation and predissociation Another fate for an electronically excited molecule is dissociation, the breaking of bonds (Fig.</li>
        <li>Absorption occurs in a continuous band above this dissociation limit because the ﬁnal state is an unquantized translational motion of the fragments.</li>
        <li>Locating the dis- sociation limit is a valuable way of determining the bond dissociation energy.</li>

      <h2>14.5 General principles of laser action</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The word laser is an acronym formed from light ampliﬁcation by stimulated emission I of radiation.</li>
        <li>In stimulated emission, an excited state is stimulated to emit a photon by radiation of the same frequency; the more photons that are present, the greater the A probability of the emission.</li>
        <li>The essential feature of laser action is positive-feedback: the more photons present of the appropriate frequency, the more photons of that Laser action frequency that will be stimulated to form.</li>
        <li>Pump (a) Population inversion One requirement of laser action is the existence of a metastable excited state, an X excited state with a long enough lifetime for it to participate in stimulated emission.</li>
        <li>Another requirement is the existence of a greater population in the metastable state Fig.</li>

      <h2>14.6 Applications of lasers in chemistry</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>What follows is only an initial listing of applications of lasers to chemistry.</li>
        <li>We see throughout the text how lasers are also used in the study of macromolecules (Chapter 19) and reaction dynamics (Chapter 24).</li>
        <li>One application of multiphoton processes is that states inaccess- ible by conventional one-photon spectroscopy become observable because the overall transition occurs with no change of parity.</li>
        <li>For example, in one-photon spectroscopy, only g ↔ u transitions are observable; in two-photon spectroscopy, however, the over- all outcome of absorbing two photons is a g → g or a u → u transition.</li>
        <li>The monochromaticity of laser radiation is also a great advantage, for it makes possible the observation of scattered light that diﬀers by only fractions of reciprocal centimetres from the incident radiation.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas & their meaning</h3>

        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>all outcome of absorbing two photons is a g → g or a u → u transition.</code>. This relation links the quantities shown; treat it as a compact statement of how changing one variable constrains the others.</li>
        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>BCl3 + C6H6 → C6H5-BCl2 + HCl</code>. This relation links the quantities shown; treat it as a compact statement of how changing one variable constrains the others.</li>
        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>A + hν → A* (absorption)</code>. This relation links the quantities shown; treat it as a compact statement of how changing one variable constrains the others.</li>
        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>A* → A (emission)</code>. This relation links the quantities shown; treat it as a compact statement of how changing one variable constrains the others.</li>
