    <h1>Chapter 15 Tutorial — Molecular spectroscopy 3 magnetic resonance</h1>
    <p>Molecular spectroscopy 3: magnetic resonance 15 One of the most widely used spectroscopic procedures in chemistry makes use of the The effect of magnetic fields on classical concept of resonance. The chapter begins with an account of conventional nuclear electrons and nuclei magnetic resonance, which shows how the resonance frequency of a magnetic nucleus is 15.1 The energies of electrons in affected by its electronic environment and the presence of magnetic nuclei in its vicinity.</p>

        <li>Because γ $B 0 /h is the Larmor frequency of the nucleus, this resonance occurs when the frequency of the electromagnetic ﬁeld matches the Larmor frequency (ν = νL ).</li>
        <li>Larmor frequencies of nuclei at the ﬁelds normally employed (about 12 T) typically lie in the radiofrequency region of the electromagnetic spectrum (close to 500 MHz), so NMR is a radiofre- quency technique.</li>

      <h2>15.5 The chemical shift</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The calculation of reliable values of the shielding constant is very diﬃcult, but trends in it are quite well understood and we concentrate on them.</li>
        <li>Other references are used for other nuclei.</li>
        <li>For 13C, the reference frequency is the 13C resonance in TMS; for 31P it is the 31P resonance in 85 per cent H3PO4(aq).</li>
        <li>The advantage of the δ -scale is that shifts reported on it are independent of the applied ﬁeld (because both numerator and denominator are pro- portional to the applied ﬁeld).</li>
        <li>A note on good practice In much of the literature, chemical shifts are reported in ‘parts per million’, ppm, in recognition of the factor of 106 in the deﬁnition.</li>

        <li>The strength of the interaction is expressed in terms of the scalar coupling constant, J, and reported in hertz (Hz).</li>
        <li>The scalar coupling constant is so called because the energy of interaction it describes is proportional to the scalar product of the two interacting Fig.</li>

      <h2>15.8 The Magnetization Vector</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The dependence of the rate of exchange on the temperature is used to determine the energy barrier to interconversion.</li>
        <li>For example, hydroxyl protons are able to exchange with water protons.</li>
        <li>The eﬀect is observed when the lifetime of a molecule due to this chemical exchange is so short that the lifetime broadening is greater than the doublet splitting.</li>
        <li>Because this splitting is often very small (a few hertz), a proton must remain attached to the same molecule for longer than about 0.1 s for the splitting to be observable.</li>
        <li>In water, the exchange rate is much faster than that, so alcohols show no splitting from the OH protons.</li>

      <h2>15.13 Solid-state NMR</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The principal diﬃculty with the application of NMR to solids is the low resolution characteristic of solid samples.</li>
        <li>Nevertheless, there are good reasons for seeking to overcome these diﬃculties.</li>
        <li>They include the possibility that a compound of interest is unstable in solution or that it is insoluble, so conventional solution NMR cannot be employed.</li>
        <li>Moreover, many species are intrinsically interesting as solids, and it is important to determine their structures and dynamics.</li>
        <li>Synthetic polymers are particu- larly interesting in this regard, and information can be obtained about the arrange- ment of molecules, their conformations, and the motion of diﬀerent parts of the chain.</li>

      <h2>15.14 The Epr Spectrometer</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>γ $µ 0mI B loc = − (1 – 3 cos2θ) (15.39) 4πR3 Unlike in solution, this ﬁeld is not motionally averaged to zero.</li>
        <li>Typical dipole ﬁelds are of the order of 10−3 T, which corresponds to splittings and linewidths of the order of 104 Hz.</li>
        <li>A second source of linewidth is the anisotropy of the chemical shift.</li>
        <li>In general, this ability depends on the orientation of the molecule Magnetic field relative to the applied ﬁeld.</li>
        <li>In solution, when the molecule is tumbling rapidly, only the average value of the chemical shift is relevant.</li>

        <li>varying from 0 to 6, because in them ∆E is small (on account of the splitting of d- orbitals brought about by interactions with ligands, as we saw in Section 14.2).</li>
        <li>Just as in the case of the chemical shift in NMR spectroscopy, the g-value is anisotropic: that is, its magnitude depends on the orientation of the radical with respect to the applied ﬁeld.</li>
        <li>In solution, when the molecule is tumbling rapidly, only the average value of the g-value is observed.</li>
        <li>Therefore, anisotropy of the g-value is observed only for radicals trapped in solids.</li>
