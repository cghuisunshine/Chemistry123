      <h2>17.2 The Molecular Partition Function</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Therefore, for such a gas, H − H(0) = –52 nRT (17.5)° (d) The Gibbs energy One of the most important thermodynamic functions for chemistry is the Gibbs energy, G = H − TS = A + pV.</li>
        <li>Now we see another interpretation of the Gibbs energy: it is pro- portional to the logarithm of the average number of thermally accessible states per molecule.</li>
        <li>The electronic contribution is not actually a ‘mode of motion’, but it is con- venient to include it here.</li>
        <li>The separation of terms in eqn 17.10 is only approximate (except for translation) because the modes are not completely independent, but in most cases it is satisfactory.</li>
        <li>The separation of the vibrational and rotational modes is justiﬁed to the extent that the rotational constant is independent of the vibrational state.</li>

        <li>The starting point for the discussion of solids is the well ordered structure of a perfect crystal, which will be discussed in Chapter 20.</li>
        <li>The starting point for the discussion of gases is the completely disordered distribution of the molecules of a perfect gas, as we saw in Chapter 1.</li>

      <h2>17.7 Residual Entropies</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>(c) The thermodynamic properties of liquids Once g(r) is known it can be used to calculate the thermodynamic properties of liquids.</li>
        <li>Likewise, the contribution that pairwise interactions make to the pressure is ∞  pV 2πN dV2 =1− g(r)v2r 2dr v2 = r (17.51a) nRT kTV 0 dr The quantity v2 is called the virial (hence the term ‘virial equation of state’).</li>
        <li>The second term is essentially the internal pressure, πT = (∂U/∂V)T , introduced in Section 2.11, representing the con- tribution to the pressure from the intermolecular forces.</li>
        <li>To see the connection, we should recognize −dV2 /dr (in v2) as the force required to move two molecules apart, and therefore −r(dV2 /dr) as the work required to separate the molecules through a distance r.</li>
        <li>In brief, the integral, when multiplied by the square of the number density, is the change in internal energy of the system as it expands, and therefore is equal to the internal pressure.</li>
