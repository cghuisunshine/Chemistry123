    <p>5 Simple mixtures The thermodynamic description This chapter begins by developing the concept of chemical potential to show that it is a par- of mixtures ticular case of a class of properties called partial molar quantities. Then it explores how to use the chemical potential of a substance to describe the physical properties of mixtures.</p>

      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>In the latter case there is so much ethanol present that each H2O molecule is surrounded by ethanol molecules, and the packing of the molecules results in the H2O molecules increasing the volume by only 18 14 cm3.</li>
        <li>The quantity 14 cm3 mol−1 is the partial molar volume of water in pure 56 ethanol.</li>
        <li>In general, the partial molar volume of a substance A in a mixture is the change in volume per mole of A added to a large volume of the mixture.</li>
        <li>The partial molar volumes of water and ethanol across the full composition range at 25°C are shown in Fig.</li>

      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The dependence of the Gibbs energy of a mixture on its composition is given by eqn 5.5, and we know that at constant temperature and pressure systems tend towards lower Gibbs energy.</li>
        <li>This is the link we need in order to apply thermodynamics to the discussion of spontaneous changes of composition, as in the mixing of two sub- stances.</li>
        <li>One simple example of a spontaneous mixing process is that of two gases introduced into the same container.</li>
        <li>The mixing is spontaneous, so it must correspond to a decrease in G.</li>

      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>(a) Ideal solutions The Gibbs energy of mixing of two liquids to form an ideal solution is calculated in exactly the same way as for two gases (Section 5.2).</li>
        <li>As for gases, it follows that the ideal entropy of mixing of two liquids is ∆mixS = −nR{xA ln xA + xB ln xB} (5.28)° 5.4 LIQUID MIXTURES 149 and, because ∆mix H = ∆mixG + T∆mixS = 0, the ideal enthalpy of mixing is zero.</li>
        <li>It should be noted, however, that solution ideality means something diﬀerent from gas perfection.</li>
        <li>In a perfect gas there are no forces acting between molecules.</li>

      <h2>5.5 Colligative properties</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The properties we now consider are the lowering of vapour pressure, the elevation of boiling point, the depression of freezing point, and the osmotic pressure arising from the presence of a solute.</li>
        <li>For this reason, they are called col- ligative properties (denoting ‘depending on the collection’).</li>
        <li>We assume throughout the following that the solute is not volatile, so it does not contribute to the vapour.</li>
        <li>We also assume that the solute does not dissolve in the solid solvent: that is, the pure solid solvent separates when the solution is frozen.</li>
        <li>The latter assumption is quite drastic, although it is true of many mixtures; it can be avoided at the expense of more algebra, but that introduces no new principles.</li>

      <h2>5.7 The Solute Activity</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>We see that there is nothing mysterious about the activity of a solvent: it can be determined experimentally simply by measuring the vapour pressure and then using eqn 5.43.</li>
        <li>The chemical potential of the solvent is then µA = µA* + RT ln xA + RT ln γA (5.46) The standard state of the solvent, the pure liquid solvent at 1 bar, is established when xA = 1.</li>
        <li>5.7 The solute activity The problem with deﬁning activity coeﬃcients and standard states for solutes is that they approach ideal-dilute (Henry’s law) behaviour as xB → 0, not as xB → 1 (corres- ponding to pure solute).</li>
        <li>We shall show how to set up the deﬁnitions for a solute that obeys Henry’s law exactly, and then show how to allow for deviations.</li>

        <li>We show in the following Justiﬁcation that eqn 5.31 implies that the activ- ity coeﬃcients are given by expressions of the form ln γA = βxB2 ln γB = βxA2 (5.57) These relations are called the Margules equations.</li>
        <li>An ideal 2 solution corresponds to β = 0 and gives a pA = {xAeβ(1−xA) }pA* (5.59) straight line, in accord with Raoult’s law.</li>
