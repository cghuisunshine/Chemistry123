# Chapter 2 Tutorial — The First Law

2 The First Law The basic concepts This chapter introduces some of the basic concepts of thermodynamics. It concentrates on the conservation of energy—the experimental observation that energy can be neither created nor destroyed—and shows how the principle of the conservation of energy can be surroundings in terms of the work it may do or the heat that it may produce.

## 2.1 Work, Heat, And Energy

### Key ideas
- An isolated system is a closed system that has neither mechanical nor thermal contact with its surroundings.
- 2.1 Work, heat, and energy The fundamental physical property in thermodynamics is work: work is motion against an opposing force.
- Doing work is equivalent to raising a weight somewhere in the surroundings.
- An example of doing work is the expansion of a gas that pushes out a piston and raises a weight.
- The energy of a system is its capacity to do work.

## 2.2 The internal energy

### Key ideas
- In thermodynamics, the total energy of a system is called its internal energy, U.
- 2.2 THE INTERNAL ENERGY 31 The internal energy is a state function in the sense that its value depends only on the current state of the system and is independent of how that state has been prepared.
- In other words, it is a function of the properties that determine the current state of the system.
- The internal energy is an extensive property.
- That the Comment 2.1 internal energy is a state function has consequences of the greatest importance, as we start to unfold in Section 2.10.

## 2.3 Expansion Work

### Key ideas
- The equation states that the change in internal energy of a closed system is equal to the energy that passes through its bound- ary as heat or work.
- It employs the ‘acquisitive convention’, in which w > 0 or q > 0 if energy is transferred to the system as work or heat and w < 0 or q < 0 if energy is lost from the system as work or heat.
- The term ‘expansion work’ also includes work associated with negat- ive changes of volume, that is, compression.
- 2.6, in which one wall of a system is a massless, frictionless, rigid, perfectly ﬁtting piston of area A.
- If the external pressure is pex, the magnitude of the force acting on the outer face of the piston is F = pex A.

## 2.4 Heat Transactions

### Key ideas
- If there is no change in volume, there is no expansion work however the process takes place.
- A general feature of processes in which a condensed phase changes into a gas is that the volume of the former may usually be neglected relative to that of the gas it forms.
- Answer In (a) the volume cannot change, so no expansion work is done and w = 0.
- In (b) the gas drives back the atmosphere and therefore w = −pex ∆V.
- We can neglect the initial volume because the ﬁnal volume (after the production of gas) is so much larger and ∆V = Vf − Vi ≈ Vf = nRT/pex, where n is the amount of H2 pro- duced.

## 2.5 Enthalpy

### Key ideas
- The change in internal energy is not equal to the energy transferred as heat when the system is free to change its volume.
- Under these circumstances some of the energy supplied as heat to the system is returned to the surroundings as expansion work (Fig.
- However, we shall now show that in this case the energy supplied as heat at constant pressure is equal to the change in another thermodynamic property of the system, the enthalpy.
- (a) The deﬁnition of enthalpy The enthalpy, H, is deﬁned as Fig.

- This relation shows that the enthalpy change is then the area under the curve of Cp,ex against T.

## 2.7 Standard Enthalpy Changes

### Key ideas
- Thermochemistry The study of the energy transferred as heat during the course of chemical reactions is called thermochemistry.
- Thermochemistry is a branch of thermodynamics because a reaction vessel and its contents form a system, and chemical reactions result in the exchange of energy between the system and the surroundings.
- We have already remarked that a process that releases energy by heating the sur- roundings is classiﬁed as exothermic and one that absorbs energy by cooling the sur- roundings is classiﬁed as endothermic.
- Because the release of energy by heating the surroundings signiﬁes a decrease in the enthalpy of a system (at constant pressure), we can now see that an exothermic process at constant pressure is one for which ∆H < 0.
- 2.7 Standard enthalpy changes Changes in enthalpy are normally reported for processes taking place under a set of standard conditions.

## 2.8 Standard Enthalpies Of Formation

### Key ideas
- The standard enthalpy of formation of ions in solution poses a special problem because it is impossible to prepare a solution of cations alone or of anions alone.
- In essence, this deﬁnition adjusts the actual values of the enthalpies of formation of ions by a ﬁxed amount, which is chosen so that the standard value for one of them, H+(aq), has the value zero.
- The value of ∆ r H 7 for the overall reaction is the sum of these ‘unforming’ and forming enthalpies.
- Because ‘unforming’ is the reverse of forming, the enthalpy of an unforming step is the negative of the enthalpy of formation (4).
- The question that now arises is whether we can construct standard enthalpies of formation from a knowledge of the chemical constitution of the species.

## 2.9 The temperature-dependence of reaction enthalpies

### Key ideas
- When the temperature is The standard enthalpies of many important reactions have been measured at diﬀer- increased, the enthalpy of the products and ent temperatures.
- In each case, the enthalpies at diﬀerent temperatures may be calculated from heat capacities and the change in enthalpy depends on the heat reaction enthalpy at some other temperature (Fig.
- It is normally a good approximation to assume that ∆rCp is independent of the temperature, at least over reasonably limited ranges, as illustrated in the following example.
- In some cases the temperature dependence of heat capacities is taken into account by using eqn 2.25.
- However, in the absence of this information, standard reaction the reactants both increase, but may do so to diﬀerent extents.

## 2.11 Changes In Internal Energy

### Key ideas
- The work of free expansion is zero (Section 2.3b); so in Path 1, w = 0 and q = 0.
- For Path 2, the work is given by eqn 2.11, so w = −nRT ln(Vf /Vi) and consequently q = nRT ln(Vf /Vi).
- These results are consequences of the path independence of U, a state function, and the path dependence of q and w, which are path functions.
- The internal energy U can be regarded as a function of V, T, and p, but, because there is an equation of state, stating the values of two of the variables ﬁxes the value of the third.
- Therefore, it is possible to write U in terms of just two independ- ent variables: V and T, p and T, or p and V.

## 2.12 The Joule–Thomson Effect

### Key ideas
- Equation 2.46 provides an easy way to derive the relation between Cp and CV for a perfect gas expressed in eqn 2.26.
- We show in Further information 2.2 that in general α 2TV Cp − CV = (2.49) κT Equation 2.49 applies to any substance (that is, it is ‘universally true’).
- Because expansion coeﬃcients α of liquids and solids are small, it is tempting to deduce from eqn 2.49 that for them Cp ≈ CV.
- But this is not always so, because the compressibility κT might also be small, so α 2/κT might be large.
