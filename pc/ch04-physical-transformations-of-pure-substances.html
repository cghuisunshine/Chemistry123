      <h3>Key ideas</h3>

        <li>pressures and temperatures at which each phase of a substance is the most stable.</li>
        <li>The practical import- technology: Supercritical fluids ance of the expressions we derive is that they show how the vapour pressure of a sub- stance varies with temperature and how the melting point varies with pressure.</li>
        <li>This chapter also introduces the chemical transitions potential, a property that is at the centre of discussions of phase transitions and chemical reactions.</li>
        <li>Exercises Problems 4.1 The stabilities of phases A phase of a substance is a form of matter that is uniform throughout in chemical composition and physical state.</li>
        <li>Thus, at 1 atm, ice is the stable phase of water below 0°C, but above 0°C liquid water is more stable.</li>

      <h2>4.2 Phase Boundaries</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>That is, above the critical temperature, the liquid phase of the substance does not exist.</li>
        <li>(b) Melting points and triple points The temperature at which, under a speciﬁed pressure, the liquid and solid phases of a substance coexist in equilibrium is called the melting temperature.</li>
        <li>Because a sub- stance melts at exactly the same temperature as it freezes, the melting temperature of a substance is the same as its freezing temperature.</li>
        <li>The freezing temperature when the pressure is 1 atm is called the normal freezing point, Tf, and its freezing point when the pressure is 1 bar is called the standard freezing point.</li>
        <li>The normal and stand- (a) (b) (c) ard freezing points are negligibly diﬀerent for most purposes.</li>

      <h2>4.3 Three typical phase diagrams</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>(a) Carbon dioxide The phase diagram for carbon dioxide is shown in Fig.</li>
        <li>To obtain the liquid, it is necessary to exert a pressure of at least 5.11 atm.</li>
        <li>Cylinders of carbon dioxide generally contain the liquid or compressed gas; at 25°C that implies a vapour pressure of 67 atm if both gas and liquid are present in equilibrium.</li>
        <li>When the gas squirts through the throttle it cools by the Joule–Thomson eﬀect, so when it emerges into a region where the pressure is only 1 atm, it condenses into a ﬁnely divided snow-like solid.</li>
        <li>(b) Water Figure 4.5 is the phase diagram for water.</li>

      <h2>4.4 The thermodynamic criterion of equilibrium</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>We base our discussion on the following consequence of the Second Law: at equilibrium, the chemical potential of a substance is the same throughout a sample, regardless of how many phases are present.</li>
        <li>When the liquid and solid phases of a substance are in equilibrium, the chemical potential of the substance is the same throughout the system (Fig.</li>
        <li>To see the validity of this remark, consider a system in which the chemical poten- tial of a substance is µ1 at one location and µ2 at another location.</li>
        <li>The overall change is therefore dG = (µ2 − µ1)dn.</li>
        <li>If the chemical potential at location 1 is higher than that at location 2, the transfer is accompanied by a decrease in G, and so has a spontaneous tendency to occur.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas & their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>that material is added to location 2. The overall change is therefore dG = (µ2 − µ1)dn.</code>. This relation links the quantities shown; treat it as a compact statement of how changing one variable constrains the others.</li>

      <h2>4.5 The dependence of stability on the conditions</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>At low temperatures and provided the pressure is not too low, the solid phase of a substance has the lowest chemical potential and is therefore the most stable phase.</li>
        <li>When that happens, a transition to the second phase is spontaneous and occurs if it is kinetically feasible to do so.</li>
        <li>stable stable stable Equation 4.1 implies that the slope of a plot of µ against temperature is steeper for Tf Tb gases than for liquids, because Sm(g) > Sm(l).</li>
        <li>The slope is also steeper for a liquid than Temperature, T the corresponding solid, because Sm(l) > Sm(s) almost always.</li>
        <li>These features are illus- trated in Fig.</li>

      <h2>4.6 The location of phase boundaries</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Therefore, where dp the phases α and β are in equilibrium, Phase µα(p,T) = µβ(p,T) (4.4) a By solving this equation for p in terms of T, we get an equation for the phase boundary.</li>
        <li>4.12 When pressure is applied to a and β remain in equilibrium.</li>
        <li>The chemical potentials of the phases are initially equal system in which two phases are in (the two phases are in equilibrium).</li>
        <li>They remain equal when the conditions are equilibrium (at a), the equilibrium is changed to another point on the phase boundary, where the two phases continue to disturbed.</li>
        <li>Therefore, the changes in the chemical potentials of the the temperature, so moving the state of the two phases must be equal and we can write dµα = dµβ.</li>

        <li>The Liquid experimental value is 10 kPa.</li>
        <li>Gas (d) The solid–vapour boundary The only diﬀerence between this case and the last is the replacement of the enthalpy of vaporization by the enthalpy of sublimation, ∆subH.</li>

        <li>There are many diﬀerent types of phase transition, including the familiar examples of fusion and vaporization and the less familiar examples of solid–solid, conducting– superconducting, and ﬂuid–superﬂuid transitions.</li>
