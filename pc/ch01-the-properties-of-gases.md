## 1.3 Molecular interactions

### Key ideas
- Real gases show deviations from the perfect gas law because molecules interact with Contact one another.
- Repulsive forces are signiﬁcant only when molecules are almost in contact: they are Potential energy short-range interactions, even on a scale measured in molecular diameters (Fig.
- Because they are short-range interactions, repulsions can be expected to be important only when the average separation of the molecules is small.
- This is the case at high pressure, when many molecules occupy a small volume.
- On the other hand, attractive Repulsions dominant intermolecular forces have a relatively long range and are eﬀective over several molecu- lar diameters.

## 1.4 The Van Der Waals Equation

### Key ideas
- Near A, the pressure of the gas rises in approximate agreement with Boyle’s law.
- Serious devi- ations from that law begin to appear when the volume has been reduced to B.
- Examination of the contents of the vessel shows that just to the left of C a liquid appears, and there are two phases separated by a sharply deﬁned surface.
- As the volume is decreased from C through D to E, the amount of liquid increases.
- There is no additional resistance to the piston because the gas can respond by condensing.

## 1.5 The Principle Of Corresponding States

### Key ideas
- From the properties of curves, we know that an inﬂexion of this type occurs when both the ﬁrst and second derivatives are zero.
- They can be tested by noting that the critical com- pression factor, Zc, is predicted to be equal to pcVc 3 Zc = = (1.23) RTc 8 for all gases.
- We see from Table 1.5 that, although Zc < 38 = 0.375, it is approximately constant (at 0.3) and the discrepancy is reasonably small.
- We have seen that the critical constants are characteristic proper- ties of gases, so it may be that a scale can be set up by using them as yardsticks.
- The success of the procedure is strikingly clear: compare this graph with Fig.
