Rotational energy levels are considered ﬁrst, and we see how to derive expressions for…

## 13.1 Experimental Techniques

### Key ideas
- In absorption radiation spectroscopy, the net absorption of nearly monochromatic (single frequency) incid- ent radiation is monitored as the radiation is swept over a range of frequencies.
- We say net absorption, because it will become clear that, when a sample is irradiated, both absorption and emission at a given frequency are stimulated, and the detector meas- ures the diﬀerence, the net absorption.
- We shall discuss emission spectroscopy in a lower frequency if it loses energy to the Chapter 14; here we focus on absorption spectroscopy, which is widely employed in molecule.
- taking place by an excitation of the In Chapter 9 we saw that transitions between electronic energy levels are stimulated molecule to a wide range of states by or emit ultraviolet, visible, or near-infrared radiation.
- subsequent return of the molecule to a First, the direct absorption or emission of infrared radiation can cause changes in lower state; the net energy change is then carried away by the photon.

## 13.2 The intensities of spectral lines

### Key ideas
- Monochromator or interferometer The ratio of the transmitted intensity, I, to the incident intensity, I0, at a given frequency is called the transmittance, T, of the sample at that frequency: Fig.
- The Beer–Lambert law: spectrum is analysed by a monochromator or an interferometer.
- I = I010−ε[J]l (13.2) The quantity ε is called the molar absorption coeﬃcient (formerly, and still widely, the ‘extinction coeﬃcient’).
- The molar absorption coeﬃcient depends on the frequency of the incident radiation and is greatest where the absorption is most intense.
- Its dimensions are 1/(concentration × length), and it is normally convenient to express it in cubic decimetres per mole per centimetre (dm3 mol−1 cm−1).

## 13.4 Moments Of Inertia

### Key ideas
- In most cases, absorption by an inter- stellar species is detected against the background of infrared radiation emitted by a nearby star.
- However, rA infrared emissions can be observed if molecules are occasionally excited by high- energy photons emitted by hot stars in the vicinity of the cloud.
- In this molecule there are three the populations of the states.
- The moment of inertia of a molecule is deﬁned as the mass of each atom multiplied by the square of its distance from the rotational axis through the centre of mass of the molecule (Fig.

- m (a) Rotational selection rules We have already remarked (Section 13.2) that the gross selection rule for the observa- tion of a pure rotational spectrum is that a molecule must have a permanent electric dipole moment.
- That is, for a molecule to give a pure rotational spectrum, it must be m polar.
- The classical basis of this rule is that a polar molecule appears to possess a ﬂuctuating dipole when rotating, but a nonpolar molecule does not (Fig.13.17).
- Homonuclear diatomic molecules and symmetrical linear molecules such as CO2 are rotationally Fig.

## 13.7 Rotational Raman Spectra

### Key ideas
- Speciﬁcally, the population of a rotational energy level J is given by the Boltzmann expression NJ ∝ NgJ e−EJ /kT where N is the total number of molecules and gJ is the degeneracy of the level J.
- The value of J corresponding to a maximum of this expression is found by treating J as a continuous variable, diﬀerentiating with respect to J, and then setting the result equal to zero.
- The result is (see Problem 13.24) 1/2 A kT D Jmax ≈ − –12 (13.39) C 2hcB F For a typical molecule (for example, OCS, with B = 0.2 cm−1) at room temperature, kT ≈ 1000hcB, so Jmax ≈ 30.
- However, it must be recalled that the intensity of each transition also depends on the value of J (eqn 13.36) and on the population diﬀerence between the two states involved in the transition (see Section 13.2).
- Hence the value of J corresponding to the most intense line is not quite the same as the value of J for the most highly populated level.

## 13.8 Nuclear statistics and rotational states

### Key ideas
- If eqn 13.42 is used in conjunction with the rotational Raman spectrum of CO2, the rotational constant is inconsistent with other measurements of C-O bond lengths.
- 13.8 NUCLEAR STATISTICS AND ROTATIONAL STATES 451 The results are consistent only if it is supposed that the molecule can exist in states with even values of J, so the Stokes lines are 2 ← 0, 4 ← 2, .
- The form of the Pauli principle J=2 given in Justiﬁcation Section 10.4 states that, when two identical bosons are exchanged, the overall wavefunction must remain unchanged in every respect, including sign.
- In particular, when a CO2 molecule rotates through 180°, two identical O nuclei are interchanged, so the overall wavefunction of the molecule must remain unchanged.
- Therefore, only even values of J are permissible for CO2, and hence the Raman spectrum shows only alternate lines.

## 13.11 Anharmonicity

### Key ideas

- In the harmonic approximation, all these lines lie at the same frequency, and the spectrum is also a single line.
- However, as we shall now show, the D0 De breakdown of the harmonic approximation causes the transitions to lie at slightly diﬀerent frequencies, so several lines are observed.

## 13.14 Normal modes

### Key ideas
- As shown in the Justiﬁcation below, for a nonlinear molecule that consists of N atoms, there are 3N − 6 independent modes of vibration.
- If the molecule is linear, there are 3N − 5 independent vibrational modes.
- 13.38 The structure of a vibrational line The total number of coordinates needed to specify the locations of N atoms is 3N.
- in the vibrational Raman spectrum of Each atom may change its location by varying one of its three coordinates (x, y, carbon monoxide, showing the O, Q, and S and z), so the total number of displacements available is 3N.
- For example, three coordinates are needed to specify the location of the centre of mass of the molecule, so three of the 3N displacements correspond to the translational motion of the molecule q as a whole.

## 13.16 Vibrational Raman spectra of polyatomic molecules

### Key ideas
- The normal modes of vibration of molecules are Raman active if they are accom- panied by a changing polarizability.
- It is sometimes quite diﬃcult to judge by inspec- tion when this is so.
- The symmetric stretch of CO2, for example, alternately swells and contracts the molecule: this motion changes the polarizability of the molecule, so the mode is Raman active.
- The other modes of CO2 leave the polarizability unchanged, so they are Raman inactive.
- (A mode may be inactive in both.) Because it is often possible to judge intuitively if a I mode changes the molecular dipole moment, we can use this rule to identify modes that are not Raman active.

- Method The ﬁrst step in the procedure is to identify the symmetry species of the x 4 irreducible representations spanned by all the 3N displacements of the atoms, using the characters of the molecular point group.
- Find these characters by count- ing 1 if the displacement is unchanged under a symmetry operation, −1 if it changes sign, and 0 if it is changed into some other displacement.
- Finally, subtract the symmetry species of the rotations, and the symmetry elements used to which are also given in the character table (and denoted there by R x, R y, or R z).
- Answer There are 3 × 5 = 15 degrees of freedom, of which (3 × 5) − 6 = 9 are vibra- tions.
- Under E, no displacement coordinates are changed, so the character is 15.
