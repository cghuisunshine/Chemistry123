# Chapter 9 Tutorial — Quantum theory techniques and applications

Quantum theory: techniques and applications 9 To ﬁnd the properties of systems according to quantum mechanics we need to solve the Translational motion appropriate Schrödinger equation. This chapter presents the essentials of the solutions for three basic types of motion: translation, vibration, and rotation.
