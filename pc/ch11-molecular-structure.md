# Chapter 11 Tutorial — Molecular structure

11 Molecular structure The Born–Oppenheimer The concepts developed in Chapter 10, particularly those of orbitals, can be extended to approximation a description of the electronic structures of molecules. There are two principal quantum mechanical theories of molecular electronic structure.

## 11.1 Homonuclear Diatomic Molecules

### Key ideas
- is not possible for any molecule because the simplest molecule consists of three particles (two nuclei and one electron).
- We can therefore think of the nuclei as being ﬁxed at arbitrary locations, Energy and then solve the Schrödinger equation for the wavefunction of the electrons alone.
- 0 The Born–Oppenheimer approximation allows us to select an internuclear separa- tion in a diatomic molecule and then to solve the Schrödinger equation for the elec- trons at that nuclear separation.
- 11.1 A molecular potential energy meter is changed in a polyatomic molecule, we obtain a potential energy surface.
- The equilibrium bond length is called a potential energy curve because the kinetic energy of the stationary nuclei corresponds to the energy minimum.

## 11.2 Polyatomic Molecules

### Key ideas
- It is so called because, viewed along the inter- Nodal plane nuclear axis, a π bond resembles a pair of electrons in a p orbital (and π is the Greek equivalent of p).
- There are two π bonds in N2, one formed by spin pairing in two neighbouring 2px orbitals and the other by spin pairing in two neighbouring 2py orbitals.
- The overall bonding pattern in N2 is therefore a σ bond plus two π bonds (Fig.
- 11.5), which is con- sistent with the Lewis structure :N.N: for nitrogen.
- 11.2 Polyatomic molecules Internuclear axis Each σ bond in a polyatomic molecule is formed by the spin pairing of electrons in atomic orbitals with cylindrical symmetry about the relevant internuclear axis.

### Key ideas
- A R B The one-electron wavefunctions obtained by solving the Schrödinger equation 1 Hψ = Eψ are called molecular orbitals (MO).
- A molecular orbital is like an atomic orbital, but spreads throughout the molecule.
- Therefore, we adopt a simpler procedure that, while more approximate, can be extended readily to other molecules.
- The technical term for the superposition in eqn 11.7 is a linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO).

### Key ideas
- so, whereas 1σ becomes 1σg, its antibonding partner, which so far we have called 2σ, Comment 11.4 is the ﬁrst orbital of a different symmetry, and is denoted 1σu.
- The general rule is that When treating homonuclear diatomic each set of orbitals of the same symmetry designation is labelled separately.
- The general procedure is to construct molecular orbitals by combining the available atomic orbitals.
- We also take note of Hund’s maximum multiplicity rule (Section 10.4) that, if electrons do occupy different degenerate orbitals, then a lower energy is obtained if they do so with parallel spins.
- At the experimental internuclear separation these orbitals will electronic conﬁguration of H2 is obtained have the energies shown in Fig.

- The bond in HF, for instance, is polar, with the electron pair closer to the F atom.
- The accumulation of the electron pair near the F atom results in that atom having a net negative charge, which is called a partial negative charge and denoted δ −.

### Key ideas
- First we shall consider conjugated molecules, in which there is an alternation of single and double bonds along a chain of carbon atoms.
- In his approach, the π orbitals are treated separately from the σ orbitals, and the latter form a rigid framework that determines the general shape of the molecule.
- All the C atoms are treated identically, so all the Coulomb integrals α for the atomic orbitals that con- tribute to the π orbitals are set equal.
- In ethene, for instance, we would write ψ = cAA + cBB (11.36) where the A is a C2p orbital on atom A, and so on.
- Next, the optimum coeﬃcients and energies are found by the variation principle as explained in Section 11.5.

## 11.8 The prediction of molecular properties

### Key ideas
- The results of molecular orbital calculations are only approximate, with deviations from experimental values increasing with the size of the molecule.
- Therefore, one goal of computational chemistry is to gain insight into trends in properties of molecules, without necessarily striving for ultimate accuracy.
- The raw output of a molecular structure calculation is a list of the coeﬃcients of the atomic orbitals in each molecular orbital and the energies of these orbitals.
- Different signs of the wavefunctions are represented by different colours.
- Once the coeﬃcients are known, we can build up a representation of the electron density in the molecule by noting which orbitals are occupied and then forming the squares of those orbitals.
