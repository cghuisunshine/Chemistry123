- That is, P ∝ ψ 2δV, with ψ 2 ∝ e−2r/a0.
- Note that it is more probable (by a factor of 7) that the electron will be found at the nucleus than in a volume element of the same size located at a distance a0 from the nucleus.
- The negatively charged electron is attracted to the positively charged nucleus, and is likely to be found close to it.
- A note on good practice The square of a wavefunction is not a probability: it is a Fig.

## 8.5 The Information In A Wavefunction

### Key ideas
- In other words, if the wavefunction of the particle is given by eqn 8.20, then we cannot predict where we will ﬁnd the particle.
- Then eqn 8.19 becomes cos kx cos2 kx ψ = A(eikx + e−ikx) = 2A cos kx (8.22) The probability density now has the form |ψ |2 = (2A cos kx)*(2A cos kx) = 4| A |2 cos2kx (8.23) (b) This function is illustrated in Fig.
- The locations where the probability density is zero Fig.
- wavefunction corresponding to a deﬁnite state of linear momentum is a constant; so Speciﬁcally, a node is a point where a wavefunction passes through zero.
- The location it corresponds to a uniform probability of where a wavefunction approaches zero without actually passing through zero is not a ﬁnding the particle anywhere.

## 8.6 The Uncertainty Principle

### Key ideas
- Answer The average value is given by the expectation value  r = ψ *rψ dτ which we evaluate by using spherical polar coordinates.
- This result means that, if a very large number of measurements of the distance of the electron from the nucleus are made, then their mean value will be 79.4 pm.
- However, each diﬀerent observation will give a diﬀerent and unpredictable individual result because the wavefunction is not an eigenfunction of the operator corresponding to r.
- [31/2a0 = 91.6 pm] The mean kinetic energy of a particle in one dimension is the expectation value of the operator given in eqn 8.28.
- 8.6 The uncertainty principle We have seen that, if the wavefunction is Aeikx, then the particle it describes has a deﬁnite state of linear momentum, namely travelling to the right with momentum px = +k$.

## 8.7 The postulates of quantum mechanics

### Key ideas
- For convenience, we collect here the postulates on which quantum mechanics is based and which have been introduced in the course of this chapter.
- All dynamical information is contained in the wavefunction ψ for the system, which is a mathematical function found by solving the Schrödinger equation for the system.
- If the wavefunction of a particle has the value ψ at some point r, then the probability of ﬁnding the particle in an inﬁnitesimal volume dτ = dxdydz at that point is proportional to |ψ |2dτ.
- Observables, Ω, are represented by operators, ), built from position and momentum operators of the form $ d X=x× Yx = i dx or, more generally, from operators that satisfy the commutation relation [X, Yx] = i$.
- It is impossible to specify simultaneously, with arbitrary precision, both the momentum and the position of a particle and, more generally, any pair of observable with operators that do not commute.
