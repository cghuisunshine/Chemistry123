        <li>I1.1 Impact on environmental science: The gas laws and the weather The simplest state of matter is a gas, a form of matter that ﬁlls any container it occupies.</li>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>p = f(T,V,n) (1.1)</code>. An equation of state connects the measurable state variables of a gas; changing one variable forces at least one other to change.</li>

        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>Movable 1 Pa = 1 N m−2 [1.2a]</code>. This defines the SI unit of pressure: pressure is force spread over an area.</li>
        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>used are atmosphere (1 atm = 1.013 25 × 105 Pa exactly) and bar (1 bar = 105 Pa). A</code>. This relation links the quantities shown; treat it as a compact statement of how changing one variable constrains the others.</li>

      <h2>1.2 The Gas Laws</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>This is the proced- Increasing Pressure, p ure called ‘quantity calculus’ in which a physical quantity (such as the temperature) is the product of a numerical value (25.00) and a unit (1°C).</li>
        <li>0 0 1.2 The gas laws Volume, V The equation of state of a gas at low pressure was established by combining a series of Fig.</li>
        <li>Each curve is a hyperbola (a) The perfect gas law (pV = constant) and is called an isotherm.</li>
        <li>Equations valid in this limiting sense will be signalled by a ° on the equation number, as in these expressions.</li>
        <li>Avogadro’s principle is commonly expressed in the form ‘equal volumes of gases at the same temperature and pressure contain the same numbers of molecules’.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas & their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>T/K = (25.00°C)/°C + 273.15 = 25.00 + 273.15 = 298.15</code>. This relation links the quantities shown; treat it as a compact statement of how changing one variable constrains the others.</li>
        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>sides by the unit K then gives T = 298.15 K.</code>. This relation links the quantities shown; treat it as a compact statement of how changing one variable constrains the others.</li>

      <h2>1.3 Molecular interactions</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Real gases show deviations from the perfect gas law because molecules interact with Contact one another.</li>
        <li>Repulsive forces are signiﬁcant only when molecules are almost in contact: they are Potential energy short-range interactions, even on a scale measured in molecular diameters (Fig.</li>
        <li>Because they are short-range interactions, repulsions can be expected to be important only when the average separation of the molecules is small.</li>
        <li>This is the case at high pressure, when many molecules occupy a small volume.</li>
        <li>On the other hand, attractive Repulsions dominant intermolecular forces have a relatively long range and are eﬀective over several molecu- lar diameters.</li>

The ideal gas law: pressure, volume, amount (moles), and temperature are linked. At fixed n, higher T means higher p (if V is constant) or larger V (if p is constant).</li>

      <h2>1.4 The Van Der Waals Equation</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Near A, the pressure of the gas rises in approximate agreement with Boyle’s law.</li>
        <li>Serious devi- ations from that law begin to appear when the volume has been reduced to B.</li>
        <li>Examination of the contents of the vessel shows that just to the left of C a liquid appears, and there are two phases separated by a sharply deﬁned surface.</li>
        <li>As the volume is decreased from C through D to E, the amount of liquid increases.</li>
        <li>There is no additional resistance to the piston because the gas can respond by condensing.</li>

        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>law p = nRT/V should be replaced by</code>. The ideal gas law: pressure, volume, amount (moles), and temperature are linked. At fixed n, higher T means higher p (if V is constant) or larger V (if p is constant).</li>

      <h2>1.5 The Principle Of Corresponding States</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>From the properties of curves, we know that an inﬂexion of this type occurs when both the ﬁrst and second derivatives are zero.</li>
        <li>They can be tested by noting that the critical com- pression factor, Zc, is predicted to be equal to pcVc 3 Zc = = (1.23) RTc 8 for all gases.</li>
        <li>We see from Table 1.5 that, although Zc < 38 = 0.375, it is approximately constant (at 0.3) and the discrepancy is reasonably small.</li>
        <li>We have seen that the critical constants are characteristic proper- ties of gases, so it may be that a scale can be set up by using them as yardsticks.</li>
        <li>The success of the procedure is strikingly clear: compare this graph with Fig.</li>
