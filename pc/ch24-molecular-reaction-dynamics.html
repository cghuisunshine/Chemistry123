      <h2>24.1 Collision theory</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Reactions in solution are classiﬁed into two types: diffusion-controlled and activation- controlled.</li>
        <li>The former can be expressed quantitatively in terms of the diffusion equation.</li>
        <li>In 24.2 Diffusion-controlled reactions transition state theory, it is assumed that the reactant molecules form a complex that can be discussed in terms of the population of its energy levels.</li>
        <li>Transition state theory inspires 24.3 The material balance a thermodynamic approach to reaction rates, in which the rate constant is expressed in equation terms of thermodynamic parameters.</li>
        <li>This approach is useful for parametrizing the rates Transition state theory of reactions in solution.</li>

      <h2>24.2 Diffusion-controlled reactions</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Reactant molecules have to jostle their way through the solvent, so their encounter frequency is considerably less than in a gas.</li>
        <li>This linger- ing of one molecule near another on account of the hindering presence of solvent molecules is called the cage eﬀect.</li>
        <li>This expression solves to kd[A][B] [AB] = (24.22) ka + k′d The rate of formation of products is therefore d[P] kakd ≈ ka[AB] = k2[A][B] k2 = (24.23) dt ka + k′d Two limits can now be distinguished.</li>
        <li>kakd k2 ≈ = kd (24.24) ka In this diﬀusion-controlled limit, the rate of reaction is governed by the rate at which the reactant molecules diﬀuse through the solvent.</li>
        <li>An indication that a reaction is diﬀusion-controlled is that its rate constant is of the order of 109 dm3 mol−1 s−1 or greater.</li>

        <li>Therefore, electron transfer can occur only after thermal ﬂuc- parabolas occur, respectively.</li>
        <li>Initially, the elec-  DA  tron to be transferred occupies the HOMO of D, and the overall energy of DA is lower than that of D+A− (Fig.</li>
        <li>Over reasonably short distances r, the main mechanism of elec- tron transfer is tunnelling through the potential energy barrier depicted in Fig.</li>
        <li>As shown in the illustration, now the energy of D+A− is lower than that of DA, reﬂecting the thermo- V Energy dynamic tendency for A to remain reduced and for D to remain oxidized.</li>

      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>It is diﬃcult to measure the distance dependence of ket when the reactants are ions or molecules that are free to move in solution.</li>
        <li>In such cases, electron transfer occurs after a donor–acceptor complex forms and it is not possible to exert control over r, the edge-to-edge distance.</li>
        <li>The value of β depends on the medium through which the electron must travel from donor to acceptor.</li>
        <li>In a vacuum, 28 nm−1 < β < 35 nm−1, whereas β ≈ 9 nm−1 when the intervening medium is a molecular link between donor and acceptor.</li>
        <li>The dependence of ket on the standard reaction Gibbs energy has been investigated in systems where the edge-to-edge distance, the reorganization energy, and κν are constant for a series of reactions.</li>
