# Chapter 10 Tutorial — Atomic structure and atomic spectra

10 Atomic structure and atomic spectra The structure and spectra of We now use the principles of quantum mechanics introduced in the preceding two chap- hydrogenic atoms ters to describe the internal structures of atoms. We see what experimental information is available from a study of the spectrum of atomic hydrogen.

## 10.1 The Structure Of Hydrogenic Atoms

### Key ideas
- Both the observed spectrum and its resolution into overlapping series are shown.
- Because spectroscopic observations show that electromagnetic radiation is absorbed and emitted by atoms only at certain wavenumbers, it follows that only certain energy states of atoms are permitted.
- Our tasks in the ﬁrst part of this chapter are to deter- mine the origin of this energy quantization, to ﬁnd the permitted energy levels, and to account for the value of RH.
- The quantity µ is called the reduced mass.
- The reduced mass is very sim- ilar to the electron mass because mN, the mass of the nucleus, is much larger than the mass of an electron, so 1/µ ≈ 1/me.

## 10.2 Atomic orbitals and their energies

### Key ideas
- An atomic orbital is a one-electron wavefunction for an electron in an atom.
- Each hydrogenic atomic orbital is deﬁned by three quantum numbers, designated n, l, and Energy of widely separated stationary ml.
- When an electron is described by one of these wavefunctions, we say that it electron and nucleus ‘occupies’ that orbital.
- We could go on to say that the electron is in the state |n,l,ml .
- For instance, an electron described by the wavefunction ψ1,0,0 and in the state |1,0,0 Continuum is said to occupy the orbital with n = 1, l = 0, and ml = 0.

## 10.3 Spectroscopic transitions and selection rules

### Key ideas
- The energies of the hydrogenic atoms are given by eqn 10.11.
- It is tempting to think that all possible transitions are permissible, and that a spec- trum arises from the transition of an electron from any initial orbital to any other orbital.
- However, this is not so, because a photon has an intrinsic spin angular momentum corresponding to s = 1 (Section 9.8).
- It follows that some spectroscopic transitions are allowed, meaning that they can occur, whereas others are forbidden, meaning that they cannot occur.
- A selection rule is a statement about which transitions are allowed.

## 10.4 The orbital approximation

### Key ideas
- The wavefunction of a many-electron atom is a very complicated function of the coordinates of all the electrons, and we should write it ψ (r1,r2, .
- ), where ri is the vector from the nucleus to electron i.
- However, in the orbital approximation we sup- pose that a reasonable ﬁrst approximation to this exact wavefunction is obtained by thinking of each electron as occupying its ‘own’ orbital, and write ψ (r1,r2, .
- This description is only approximate, but it is a useful model for discussing the chemical properties of atoms, and is the starting point for more sophisticated descriptions of atomic structure.
- This is the result we need to prove.

## 10.5 Self-consistent ﬁeld orbitals

### Key ideas
- The central diﬃculty of the Schrödinger equation is the presence of the electron– electron interaction terms.
- The ﬁrst term is the total attractive interaction between the electrons and the nucleus.
- The second term is the total repulsive interaction between the electrons; rij is the distance between electrons i and j.
- In broad outline, the Hartree–Fock self- consistent ﬁeld (HF-SCF) procedure is as follows.
- A Schrödinger equation can be written for this electron by ascribing to it a potential energy due to the nuclear attraction and the repulsion from the other elec- trons.

## 10.7 Singlet And Triplet States

### Key ideas
- Typical values of Zeﬀ are a little more than 1, so we expect binding energies to be given by a term of the form −hcR/n2, but lying slightly lower in energy than this formula predicts.
- We therefore introduce a quantum defect, δ, and write the energy as −hcR/(n − δ )2.
- The quantum defect is best regarded as a purely empirical quantity.
- There are some excited states that are so diﬀuse that the 1/n2 variation is valid: these states are called Rydberg states.
- We know that the ground-state conﬁguration is 1s2, and can anticipate that an excited ms   -12 conﬁguration will be one in which one of the electrons has been promoted into a 2s orbital, giving the conﬁguration 1s12s1.

## 10.8 Spin–Orbit Coupling

- For an electron, interaction between spin and orbital the magnetic moment is antiparallel magnetic moments.
- When the angular to the orbital angular momentum, but momenta are parallel, as in (a), the proportional to it.
- For spin angular magnetic moments are aligned momentum, there is a factor 2, which unfavourably; when they are opposed, as increases the magnetic moment to twice in (b), the interaction is favourable.
- magnetic coupling is the cause of the splitting of a conﬁguration into levels.
