# Chapter 25 Tutorial — Processes at solid surfaces

Processes at solid surfaces 25 In this chapter we see how solids grow at their surfaces and how the details of the structure The growth and structure of and composition of solid surfaces can be determined experimentally. A major part of the solid surfaces material concerns the extent to which a surface is covered and the variation of the extent of 25.1 Surface growth coverage with the pressure and temperature.

## 25.1 Surface growth

### Key ideas
- A simple picture of a perfect crystal surface is as a tray of oranges in a grocery store (Fig.
- The molecule loses energy as it bounces, but it is likely to escape from the surface before it has lost enough kinetic energy to be trapped.
- The same is true, to some extent, of an ionic crystal in contact with a solution.
- There is little energy advantage for an ion in solution to discard some of its solvating molecules and stick at an exposed position on the surface.
- The picture changes when the surface has defects, for then there are ridges of Fig.

## 25.2 Surface Composition

### Key ideas
- 25.4 The spiral growth pattern is one region of the crystal is pushed up sometimes concealed because the terraces through one or more unit cells relative to are subsequently completed by further another region.
- Clarendon Press, Oxford (1978).) 25.2 Surface composition Under normal conditions, a surface exposed to a gas is constantly bombarded with molecules and a freshly prepared surface is covered very quickly.
- Just how quickly can be estimated using the kinetic model of gases and the expression (eqn 21.14) for the collision ﬂux: p ZW = (25.1a) (2πmkT)1/2 A practical form of this equation is Fig.

## 25.3 Physisorption and chemisorption

### Key ideas
- In physisorption (an abbre- viation of ‘physical adsorption’), there is a van der Waals interaction (for example, a dispersion or a dipolar interaction) between the adsorbate and the substrate.
- Van der Waals interactions have a long range but are weak, and the energy released when a

- The enthalpy of Adsorbate Dad H 7/(kJ mol−1) physisorption can be measured by monitoring the rise in temperature of a sample of known heat capacity, and typical values are in the region of 20 kJ mol−1 (Table 25.1).
- CH4 −21 This small enthalpy change is insuﬃcient to lead to bond breaking, so a physisorbed H2 −84 molecule retains its identity, although it might be distorted by the presence of the H2O −59 surface.
- N2 −21 In chemisorption (an abbreviation of ‘chemical adsorption’), the molecules (or atoms) stick to the surface by forming a chemical (usually covalent) bond, and tend to * More values are given in the Data section.
- The enthalpy of chemisorption is very much greater than that for physisorption, and typical values are in the region of 200 kJ mol−1 (Table 25.2).

## 25.5 The rates of surface processes

### Key ideas
- Another technique, second harmonic generation (SHG), is very important for the study of all types of surfaces, including thin ﬁlms and liquid–gas interfaces.
- We saw in Section 20.10 that second harmonic generation is the conver- sion of an intense, pulsed laser beam to radiation with twice its initial frequency as it passes though a material.
- In addition to a number of crystals, surfaces are also suitable materials for SHG.
- Because pulsed lasers are the excitation sources, time-resolved measurements of the kinetics and dynamics of surface processes are possible over timescales as short as femtoseconds.
- Even if the molecule does not fragment, there is likely to be an initial increase of potential energy as the molecule approaches the surface and the bonds adjust.

## 25.6 Mechanisms of heterogeneous catalysis

### Key ideas
- Heterogeneous catalysis normally depends on at least one reactant being adsorbed (usually chemisorbed) and modiﬁed to a form in which it readily undergoes reaction.
- In practice, the active phase is dispersed as very small particles of linear dimension less than 2 nm on a porous oxide support.
- The decomposition of phosphine (PH3) on tungsten is ﬁrst-order at low pressures and zeroth-order at high pressures.
- To account for these observations, we write down a plausible rate law in terms of an adsorption isotherm and explore its form in the lim- its of high and low pressure.
- If the rate is supposed to be proportional to the surface coverage and we suppose that θ is given by the Langmuir isotherm, we would write kKp v = kθ = (25.21) 1 + Kp where p is the pressure of phosphine.

## 25.7 Catalytic activity at surfaces

### Key ideas
- Molecular beam reactive scattering (MBRS) studies are able to provide detailed information about catalysed reactions.
- It has become possible to investigate how the catalytic activity of a surface depends on its structure as well as its composition.
- For this reaction, terrace sites are inactive but one molecule in ten reacts when it strikes a step.
- Likewise, the dehydrogenation of hexane to hexene depends strongly on the kink density, and it appears that kinks are needed to cleave C-C bonds.
- These observations suggest a reason why even small amounts of impurities may poison a catalyst: they are likely to attach to step and kink sites, and so impair the activity of the catalyst entirely.

## 25.8 The electrode –solution interface

### Key ideas
- electrode but are held away from it by their hydration spheres (Fig.
- Ions of opposite charge cluster close to the electrode and ions of the same charge are repelled from it.
- This is one of the reasons why meas- urements of the dynamics of electrode processes are almost always done using a large excess of supporting electrolyte (for example, a 1 m solution of a salt, an acid, or a base).
- Under such conditions, the activity coeﬃcients are almost constant because the inert ions dominate the eﬀects of local changes caused by any reactions taking place.
- Neither the Helmholtz nor the Gouy–Chapman model is a very good representa- tion of the structure of the double layer.

- The rate constant has dimensions of potential it experiences is largely length/time (with units, for example, of centimetres per second, cm s−1).
- For instance, in the deposition of 25.9 THE RATE OF CHARGE TRANSFER 935 cadmium only one electron is transferred in the rate-determining step even though overall the deposition involves the transfer of two electrons.

## 25.10 Voltammetry

### Key ideas
- Electrodes with potentials that change only slightly when a current passes through them are classiﬁed as non-polarizable.
- Those with strongly current-dependent potentials are classiﬁed as polarizable.
- From the linearized equa- tion (eqn 25.43) it is clear that the criterion for low polarizability is high exchange current density (so η may be small even though j is large).
- The calomel and H2/Pt elec- trodes are both highly non-polarizable, which is one reason why they are so extensively used as reference electrodes in electrochemistry.
- A larger overpotential is then needed to produce a given current.

## 25.12 Working Galvanic Cells

### Key ideas
- The additional potential needed to achieve a detectable rate of reaction may need to be large when the exchange current density at the electrodes is small.
- The relative rates of gas evolution or metal deposition during electrolysis can be estimated from the Butler–Volmer equation and tables of exchange current densities.
- This equation shows that metal deposition is favoured by a large exchange current density and relatively high gas evolution overpotential (so η − η′ is positive and large).
- A very crude criterion is that signiﬁcant evolution or deposition occurs only if the over- potential exceeds about 0.6 V.

## 25.13 Corrosion

### Key ideas
- The electrode poten- tials we have quoted are standard values, and they change with the pH of the medium.
- If there is a thermodynamic tendency, we must examine the kinetics of the processes involved to see whether the process occurs at a signiﬁcant rate.
- A model of a corrosion system is shown in Fig.
- The oxygen at the edges of the droplet, where the O2 concentration is higher, is reduced by electrons donated by the iron over an area A.
