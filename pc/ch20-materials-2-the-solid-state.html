      <h2>20.3 The investigation of structure</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A characteristic property of waves is that they interfere with one another, giving a greater displacement where peaks or troughs coincide and a smaller displacement where peaks coincide with troughs (Fig.</li>
        <li>According to classical electromagnetic theory, the intensity of electromagnetic radiation is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the waves.</li>
        <li>Therefore, the regions of constructive or destructive interference show up as regions of enhanced or diminished intensities.</li>
        <li>The phenomenon of diﬀraction is the interference caused by an object in the path of waves, and the pattern of varying intensity that results is called the diﬀraction pattern.</li>
        <li>Diﬀraction occurs when the dimensions of the diﬀracting object are comparable to the wavelength of the radiation.</li>

      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>However, the techniques discussed so far give only static pictures and are not useful in studies of dynamics and reactivity.</li>
        <li>Instead of the Bragg method, the Laue method is used because many reﬂections can be collected simultaneously, rotation of the sample is not required, and data acquisition times are short.</li>
        <li>In practice, this averaging dictates the time resolution of the experiment, which is commonly tens of microseconds or less.</li>
        <li>The physio- logical outcome of this cycle is a negative phototactic response, or movement of the organism away from light.</li>

        <li>However, this stacking can be done in diﬀerent ways, which result in close-packed polytypes, or structures that are identical in two dimensions (the close-packed layers) but diﬀer in the third dimension.</li>
        <li>In one, the spheres are placed so that they reproduce the ﬁrst layer (Fig.</li>

        <li>The packing fraction of 0.68 is not much smaller than the value for a Cl close-packed structure (0.74), and shows that about two-thirds of the available space is actually occupied.</li>
        <li>(a) Structure When crystals of compounds of monatomic ions (such as NaCl and MgO) are modelled by stacks of hard spheres it is essential to allow for the diﬀerent ionic radii (typically Fig.</li>

        <li>It is observed that the value of Hc depends on temperature and Tc as A T2 D Hc(T) = Hc(0) 1 − (20.36) C T 2c F where Hc(0) is the value of Hc as T → 0.</li>
        <li>Type I superconductors are also com- pletely diamagnetic below Hc, meaning that no magnetic ﬁeld lines penetrate into the material.</li>
        <li>This complete exclusion of a magnetic ﬁeld in a material is known as the Meissner eﬀect, which can be visualized by the levitation of a superconductor above a magnet.</li>
