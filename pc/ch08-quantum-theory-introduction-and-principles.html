      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>r dx dy Example 8.3 Interpreting a wavefunction y x We shall see in Chapter 12 that the wavefunction of an electron in the lowest energy state of a hydrogen atom is proportional to e−r/a0, with a0 a constant and Fig.</li>
        <li>That is, P ∝ ψ 2δV, with ψ 2 ∝ e−2r/a0.</li>
        <li>Note that it is more probable (by a factor of 7) that the electron will be found at the nucleus than in a volume element of the same size located at a distance a0 from the nucleus.</li>
        <li>The negatively charged electron is attracted to the positively charged nucleus, and is likely to be found close to it.</li>
        <li>A note on good practice The square of a wavefunction is not a probability: it is a Fig.</li>

        <li>In other words, if the wavefunction of the particle is given by eqn 8.20, then we cannot predict where we will ﬁnd the particle.</li>
        <li>Then eqn 8.19 becomes cos kx cos2 kx ψ = A(eikx + e−ikx) = 2A cos kx (8.22) The probability density now has the form |ψ |2 = (2A cos kx)*(2A cos kx) = 4| A |2 cos2kx (8.23) (b) This function is illustrated in Fig.</li>

        <li>wavefunction corresponding to a deﬁnite state of linear momentum is a constant; so Speciﬁcally, a node is a point where a wavefunction passes through zero.</li>
        <li>The location it corresponds to a uniform probability of where a wavefunction approaches zero without actually passing through zero is not a ﬁnding the particle anywhere.</li>

        <li>Answer The average value is given by the expectation value  r = ψ *rψ dτ which we evaluate by using spherical polar coordinates.</li>
        <li>This result means that, if a very large number of measurements of the distance of the electron from the nucleus are made, then their mean value will be 79.4 pm.</li>
        <li>However, each diﬀerent observation will give a diﬀerent and unpredictable individual result because the wavefunction is not an eigenfunction of the operator corresponding to r.</li>
        <li>[31/2a0 = 91.6 pm] The mean kinetic energy of a particle in one dimension is the expectation value of the operator given in eqn 8.28.</li>
        <li>8.6 The uncertainty principle We have seen that, if the wavefunction is Aeikx, then the particle it describes has a deﬁnite state of linear momentum, namely travelling to the right with momentum px = +k$.</li>

        <li>If the wavefunction of a particle has the value ψ at some point r, then the probability of ﬁnding the particle in an inﬁnitesimal volume dτ = dxdydz at that point is proportional to |ψ |2dτ.</li>
        <li>Observables, Ω, are represented by operators, ), built from position and momentum operators of the form $ d X=x× Yx = i dx or, more generally, from operators that satisfy the commutation relation [X, Yx] = i$.</li>
        <li>It is impossible to specify simultaneously, with arbitrary precision, both the momentum and the position of a particle and, more generally, any pair of observable with operators that do not commute.</li>
