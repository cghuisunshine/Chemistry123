      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The solutions of these 22.3 Integrated rate laws equations are used to predict the concentrations of species at any time after the start of the reaction.</li>
        <li>The form of the rate law also provides insight into the series of elementary steps 22.4 Reactions approaching by which a reaction takes place.</li>
        <li>The key task in this connection is the construction of a rate equilibrium law from a proposed mechanism and its comparison with experiment.</li>
        <li>The basic data of chemical kinetics are Problems then the concentrations of the reactants and products at diﬀerent times after a reac- tion has been initiated.</li>
        <li>The rates of most chemical reactions are sensitive to the tem- perature, so in conventional experiments the temperature of the reaction mixture must be held constant throughout the course of the reaction.</li>

      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>(a) The deﬁnition of rate Consider a reaction of the form A + 2 B → 3 C + D, in which at some instant the molar concentration of a participant J is [J] and the volume of the system is constant.</li>
        <li>The (a) instantaneous rate of consumption of one of the reactants at a given time is −d[R]/dt, Tangent, where R is A or B.</li>

      <h2>22.3 Integrated rate laws</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Because rate laws are diﬀerential equations, we must integrate them if we want to ﬁnd the concentrations as a function of time.</li>
        <li>However, in a number of simple cases analytical solutions, known as integrated rate laws, are easily obtained, and prove to be very useful.</li>

      <h2>22.4 Reactions approaching equilibrium</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Because all the laws considered so far disregard the possibility that the reverse reaction is important, none of them describes the overall rate when the reaction is close to equilibrium.</li>
        <li>In practice, however, most kinetic studies are made on reactions that are far from equilibrium, and the reverse reactions are unimportant.</li>
        <li>The scheme we consider is A→B v = k[A] (22.20) B→A v = k′[B] The concentration of A is reduced by the forward reaction (at a rate k[A]) but it is increased by the reverse reaction (at a rate k′[B]).</li>
        <li>The net rate of change is therefore d[A] = −k[A] + k′[B] (22.21) dt If the initial concentration of A is [A]0, and no B is present initially, then at all times [A] + [B] = [A]0.</li>
        <li>The theoretical importance of eqn 22.25 is and plot the corresponding graphs that it relates a thermodynamic quantity, the equilibrium constant, to quantities for the approach to and equilibrium of the relating to rates.</li>

      <h2>22.8 Unimolecular reactions</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>However, collisions are simple bimolecular events, so how can they result in a ﬁrst-order rate law?</li>
        <li>First-order gas-phase reactions are widely called ‘unimole- cular reactions’ because they also involve an elementary unimolecular step in which the reactant molecule changes into the product.</li>
        <li>In the Lindemann– Hinshelwood mechanism it is supposed that a reactant molecule A becomes ener- Fig.</li>
        <li>The Lindemann–Hinshelwood mechanism can be tested because it predicts that, as the concentration (and therefore the partial pressure) of A is reduced, the reaction should switch to overall second-order kinetics.</li>
        <li>Thus, when k′a[A] << kb, the rate law in eqn 22.63 is d[P] ≈ ka[A]2 (22.65) dt The physical reason for the change of order is that at low pressures the rate-determining step is the bimolecular formation of A*.</li>
