- Once it is known, a partition function can be used to calculate thermodynamic functions, heat capacities, entropies, and equilibrium constants.
- If the molecules are independent, we can go on to make the substitu- tions Q = q N (for distinguishable molecules, as in a solid) or Q = q N/N!
- All the thermodynamic functions introduced in Part 1 are related to U and S, so we have a route to their calculation from Q.

## 17.2 The Molecular Partition Function

### Key ideas
- Therefore, for such a gas, H − H(0) = –52 nRT (17.5)° (d) The Gibbs energy One of the most important thermodynamic functions for chemistry is the Gibbs energy, G = H − TS = A + pV.
- Now we see another interpretation of the Gibbs energy: it is pro- portional to the logarithm of the average number of thermally accessible states per molecule.
- The electronic contribution is not actually a ‘mode of motion’, but it is con- venient to include it here.
- The separation of terms in eqn 17.10 is only approximate (except for translation) because the modes are not completely independent, but in most cases it is satisfactory.
- The separation of the vibrational and rotational modes is justiﬁed to the extent that the rotational constant is independent of the vibrational state.

### Key ideas
- The zero-point energy, –12 hc#, can be added to the right-hand side if the mean energy 10 is to be measured from 0 rather than the lowest attainable level (the zero-point level).

## 17.5 Equations of state

### Key ideas
- The relation between p and Q in eqn 17.3 is a very important route to the equations of state of real gases in terms of intermolecular forces, for the latter can be built into Q.
- We have already seen (Example 17.1) that the partition function for a gas of inde- pendent particles leads to the perfect gas equation of state, pV = nRT.
- The total kinetic energy of a gas is the sum of the kinetic energies of the individual molecules.
- For a real gas of atoms (for which the intermolecular interactions are isotropic), Z is related to the total potential energy EP of interaction of all the particles by e dτ dτ · · · dτ 1 −βEP Z= 1 2 N (17.39) N!

## 17.6 Molecular interactions in liquids

### Key ideas
- The starting point for the discussion of solids is the well ordered structure of a perfect crystal, which will be discussed in Chapter 20.
- The starting point for the discussion of gases is the completely disordered distribution of the molecules of a perfect gas, as we saw in Chapter 1.
- (a) The radial distribution function The average relative locations of the particles of a liquid are expressed in terms of the radial distribution function, g(r).
- This function is deﬁned so that g(r)r 2dr is the probability that a molecule will be found in the range dr at a distance r from another molecule.
- In a perfect crystal, g(r) is a periodic array of sharp spikes, representing the certainty (in the absence of defects and thermal motion) that molecules (or ions) lie at deﬁnite locations.

## 17.7 Residual Entropies

### Key ideas
- (c) The thermodynamic properties of liquids Once g(r) is known it can be used to calculate the thermodynamic properties of liquids.
- Likewise, the contribution that pairwise interactions make to the pressure is ∞  pV 2πN dV2 =1− g(r)v2r 2dr v2 = r (17.51a) nRT kTV 0 dr The quantity v2 is called the virial (hence the term ‘virial equation of state’).
- The second term is essentially the internal pressure, πT = (∂U/∂V)T , introduced in Section 2.11, representing the con- tribution to the pressure from the intermolecular forces.
- To see the connection, we should recognize −dV2 /dr (in v2) as the force required to move two molecules apart, and therefore −r(dV2 /dr) as the work required to separate the molecules through a distance r.
- In brief, the integral, when multiplied by the square of the number density, is the change in internal energy of the system as it expands, and therefore is equal to the internal pressure.

## 17.8 Equilibrium constants

### Key ideas

- The equilibrium constant K of a reaction is related to the standard Gibbs energy of reaction by ∆rG 7 = −RT ln K.
- We shall consider gas phase reactions in which the equilibrium constant is expressed in terms of the partial pressures of the reactants and products.
- Occupied locations are denoted by red spheres and unoccupied locations by white spheres.
- Because only the translational 7 component depends on the pressure, we can ﬁnd q m by evaluating the partition func- 7 7 tion with V replaced by V m , where V m = RT/p 7.
