# Chapter 19 Tutorial — Materials 1 macromolecules and aggregates

19 Materials 1: macromolecules and aggregates Determination of size and shape Macromolecules exhibit a range of properties and problems that illustrate a wide variety of physical chemical principles. They need to be characterized in terms of their molar mass, their size, and their shape.

## 19.1 Mean Molar Masses

### Key ideas
- place, the sample might be a mixture of molecules with diﬀerent chain lengths and extents of cross-linking, in which case sharp X-ray images are not obtained.
- Furthermore, although work on proteins and DNA has shown how im- mensely interesting and motivating the data can be, the information is incomplete.
- A synthetic polymer, however, is polydisperse, in the sense that a sample is a mixture of molecules with various chain lengths and molar masses.
- The various techniques that are used to measure molar masses result in diﬀerent types of mean values of polydisperse systems.
- Because mi = Ni Mi /NA, we can also express this average as ∑ Ni Mi2 i Jw = (19.3) ∑ Ni Mi i This expression shows that the weight-average molar mass is proportional to the mean square molar mass.

## 19.2 Mass Spectrometry

### Key ideas
- same because the sample is monodisperse (unless there has been degradation).
- The term ‘mono- disperse’ is conventionally applied to synthetic polymers in which this index is less than 1.1; commercial polyethylene samples might be much more heterogeneous, with a ratio close to 30.
- One consequence of a narrow molar mass distribution for synthetic polymers is often a higher degree of three-dimensional long-range order in the solid and therefore higher density and melting point.
- The spread of values is controlled by the choice of catalyst and reaction conditions.
- In practice, it is found that long- range order is determined more by structural factors (branching, for instance) than by molar mass.

## 19.3 Laser light scattering

### Key ideas
- A familiar example is the light scattered by specks of dust in a sunbeam.
- Therefore, light scattering is a convenient method for the characterization of polymers, large aggregates (such as colloids), and biological systems from proteins to viruses.
- Unlike mass spectrometry, laser light scattering measurements may be performed in nearly intact samples; often the only preparation required is ﬁltration of the sample.
- Elastic light scattering is observed as the oscillating dipoles in the particle radiate at the same frequency as the frequency of the exciting electromagnetic radiation.
- If the medium is perfectly homogeneous, as in a perfect crystal, the scattered waves interfere destructively in all directions except the direction of propagation of the exciting radiation.

## 19.4 Ultracentrifugation

### Key ideas
- The rate of sedimentation depends on the strength of the ﬁeld and on the masses and shapes of the particles.
- When the sample is at equilibrium, the particles are dispersed over a range of heights in accord with the Boltzmann distribution (because the gravitational ﬁeld competes with the stirring eﬀect of thermal motion).
- The spread of heights depends on the masses of the molecules, so the equilibrium distribution is another way to determine molar mass.
- Sedimentation is normally very slow, but it can be accelerated by ultracentri- fugation, a technique that replaces the gravitational ﬁeld with a centrifugal ﬁeld.
- The eﬀect can be achieved in an ultracentrifuge, which is essentially a cylinder that can be rotated at high speed about its axis with a sample in a cell near its periphery (Fig.

## 19.5 Electrophoresis

### Key ideas
- The centrifuge is run more slowly in this technique than in the sedimentation rate method to avoid having all the solute pressed in a thin ﬁlm against the bottom of the cell.
- The condition for equilibrium is therefore A ∂ ln c D Mrω 2(1 − vρ) − RT B E =0 C ∂r F T,p and therefore, at constant temperature, Mrω 2(1 − vρ)dr d ln c = RT This expression integrates to eqn 19.20.
- 19.5 Electrophoresis Many macromolecules, such as DNA, are charged and move in response to an electric ﬁeld.
- This motion is called electrophoresis.
- Electrophoretic mobility is a result of a constant drift speed, s, reached by an ion when the driving force zeE (where, as usual, ze is the net charge and E is the ﬁeld strength) is matched by the frictional force fs.

## 19.6 Viscosity

### Key ideas
- ﬁeld is applied ﬁrst along one direction and then along a perpendicular direction.
- One way to avoid this problem and to achieve separation by molar mass is to denature the 0.5 proteins in a controlled way.
- Sodium dodecyl sulfate is an anionic detergent that is Speed, s /6 m s1) very useful in this respect: it denatures proteins, whatever their initial shapes, into 0 rods by forming a complex with them.
- Moreover, most protein molecules bind a con- stant number of ions, so the net charge per protein is well regulated.
- The 0.5 molar mass of each constituent protein is estimated by comparing its mobility in its rod-like complex form with that of a standard sample of known molar mass.

## 19.8 Random coils

### Key ideas
- The most likely conformation of a chain of identical units not capable of forming hydrogen bonds or any other type of speciﬁc bond is a random coil.
- The random coil model is a helpful starting point for estimating the orders of magnitude of the hydrodynamic properties of polymers and denatured pro- teins in solution.
- The simplest model of a random coil is a freely jointed chain, in which any bond is free to make any angle with respect to the preceding one (Fig.
- The model is obviously an oversimpliﬁcation because a bond is actually constrained to a cone of angles around a direction deﬁned by its neighbour (Fig.
- In a hypothetical one-dimensional freely jointed chain all the residues lie in a straight line, and the angle between neighbours is either 0° or 180°.

## 19.9 The structure and stability of synthetic polymers

### Key ideas
- Synthetic polymers are classiﬁed broadly as elastomers, ﬁbres, and plastics, depending on their crystallinity, the degree of three-dimensional long-range order attained in 4 the solid state.
- An elastomer is a ﬂexible polymer that can expand or contract easily upon application of an external force.
- Elastomers are polymers with numerous cross- 2 Hooke’s links that pull them back into their original shape when a stress is removed.
- A perfect F /(kT/2l ) law elastomer, a polymer in which the internal energy is independent of the extension of 0 the random coil, can be modelled as a freely jointed chain.
