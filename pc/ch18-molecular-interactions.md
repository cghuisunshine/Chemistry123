# Chapter 18 Tutorial — Molecular interactions

18 Molecular interactions Electric properties of molecules In this chapter we examine molecular interactions in gases and liquids and interpret them in terms of electric properties of molecules, such as electric dipole moments and polarizabilit- ies. All these properties reﬂect the degree to which the nuclei of atoms exert control over the by permitting them to respond more or less strongly to the effects of external electric ﬁelds.

## 18.1 Electric Dipole Moments

### Key ideas
- (a) Polar molecules A polar molecule is a molecule with a permanent electric dipole moment.
- Polar molecules also have their existing dipole dipole moment is represented by the moments temporarily modiﬁed by an applied ﬁeld.
- arrow ( added to the Lewis structure The Stark eﬀect (Section 13.5) is used to measure the electric dipole moments of for the molecule, with the + marking the molecules for which a rotational spectrum can be observed.
- Note that the direction of spectroscopy cannot be used because the sample is not volatile, decomposes on vapor- the arrow is opposite to that of µ .
- ization, or consists of molecules that are so complex that their rotational spectra cannot be interpreted.

- 18.2 POLARIZABILITIES 625 Some experimental polarizability volumes of molecules are given in Table 18.1.
- The electron distribution can be dis- torted readily if the LUMO lies close to the HOMO in energy, so the polarizability is then large.

## 18.3 Relative permittivities

### Key ideas
- For instance, water has a relative permittivity of 78 at 25°C, so the interionic Coulombic interaction energy is reduced by nearly two orders of magnitude from its vacuum value.
- The relative permittivity of a substance is large if its molecules are polar or highly polarizable.
- The slope of the graph is NA µ2/9ε 0 k and its intercept at 1/T = 0 is NAα /3ε 0.
- The slope is 10.9, so µ = 4.46 × 10−30 C m, corresponding to 1.34 D.
- Because the Debye equation describes molecules that are free to rotate, the data show that 106 camphor, which does not melt until 175°C, is rotating even in the solid.

## 18.4 Interactions Between Dipoles

### Key ideas
- Interactions between molecules A van der Waals interaction is the attractive interaction between closed-shell molecules that depends on the distance between the molecules as 1/r 6.
- In addition, there are interactions between ions and the partial charges of polar molecules and repulsive interactions that prevent the complete collapse of matter to nuclear densities.
- 18.4 Interactions between dipoles Most of the discussion in this section is based on the Coulombic potential energy of interaction between two charges (eqn 18.12a).
- A point dipole is a dipole in which the separation between the charges is much smaller than the distance at which the dipole is being observed, l << r.

## 18.6 Molecular interactions in gases

### Key ideas
- The beam is directed towards other molecules, and the scattering that occurs (b) on impact is related to the intermolecular interactions.
- The primary experimental information from a molecular beam experiment is the fraction of the molecules in the incident beam that are scattered into a particular dir- 0 b RA  R B ection.
- The fraction is normally expressed in terms of dI, the rate at which molecules are scattered into a cone that represents the area covered by the ‘eye’ of the detector (Fig.
- The role of the impact parameter is collisions of two hard spheres: (a) b = 0, most easily seen by considering the impact of two hard spheres (Fig.

## 18.7 The Liquid–Vapour Interface

### Key ideas
- The scattering pattern of real molecules, which are not hard spheres, depends on Slow molecule the details of the intermolecular potential, including the anisotropy that is present when the molecules are non-spherical.
- The variation of the scattering cross-section with the relative speed of approach should therefore give information about the strength and range of the intermolecular potential.
- A further point is that the outcome of collisions is determined by quantum, not classical, mechanics.

## 18.8 Condensation

### Key ideas
- We saw in Section 4.5 that the vapour pressure of a liquid depends on the pressure applied to the liquid.
- The pressure of the liquid outside the cavity is less than the pressure inside, so the only change is in the sign of the exponent in the last expression.
- For droplets of water of radius 1 µm and 1 nm the ratios p/p* at 25°C are about 1.001 and 3, respectively.
- The second ﬁgure, although quite large, is unreliable because at that radius the droplet is less than about 10 molecules in diameter and the basis of the calculation is suspect.
- The ﬁrst ﬁgure shows that the eﬀect is usually small; nevertheless it may have important consequences.
