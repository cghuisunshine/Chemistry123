# Chapter 20 Tutorial — Materials 2 the solid state

Materials 2: the solid state 20 First, we see how to describe the regular arrangement of atoms in crystals and the sym- Crystal lattices metry of their arrangement. Then we consider the basic principles of X-ray diffraction and see how the diffraction pattern can be interpreted in terms of the distribution of electron density in a unit cell.

## 20.1 Lattices And Unit Cells

### Key ideas

- A triclinic unit cell has no rotational sym- metry, and typically all three sides and angles are diﬀerent (Fig.
- There are only 14 distinct space lattices in three dimensions.
- These Bravais lattices C2 are illustrated in Fig.
- It is conventional to portray these lattices by primitive unit cells in some cases and by non-primitive unit cells in others.

## 20.2 The Identification Of Lattice Planes

### Key ideas
- Similarly, the {h0l} planes are parallel to b and the a {hk0} planes are parallel to c.
- (b) The separation of planes The Miller indices are very useful for expressing the separation of planes.
- For the second part, instead of repeating the calculation, note that if all three Miller indices are multiplied by n, then their separation is reduced by that factor (Fig.

## 20.3 The investigation of structure

### Key ideas
- A characteristic property of waves is that they interfere with one another, giving a greater displacement where peaks or troughs coincide and a smaller displacement where peaks coincide with troughs (Fig.
- According to classical electromagnetic theory, the intensity of electromagnetic radiation is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the waves.
- Therefore, the regions of constructive or destructive interference show up as regions of enhanced or diminished intensities.
- The phenomenon of diﬀraction is the interference caused by an object in the path of waves, and the pattern of varying intensity that results is called the diﬀraction pattern.
- Diﬀraction occurs when the dimensions of the diﬀracting object are comparable to the wavelength of the radiation.

## 20.4 Neutron And Electron Diffraction

### Key ideas
- However, the techniques discussed so far give only static pictures and are not useful in studies of dynamics and reactivity.
- Instead of the Bragg method, the Laue method is used because many reﬂections can be collected simultaneously, rotation of the sample is not required, and data acquisition times are short.
- In practice, this averaging dictates the time resolution of the experiment, which is commonly tens of microseconds or less.
- The physio- logical outcome of this cycle is a negative phototactic response, or movement of the organism away from light.
- 20.4 Neutron and electron diffraction According to the de Broglie relation (eqn 8.12, λ = h/p), particles have wavelengths and may therefore undergo diﬀraction.

## 20.5 Metallic Solids

### Key ideas
- Simplest of all (in principle) are elemental metals, where electrons are delocalized over arrays of identical cations and bind them together into a rigid but ductile and malleable whole.
- A close-packed three-dimensional structure is obtained by stacking such close-packed layers on top of one another.
- However, this stacking can be done in diﬀerent ways, which result in close-packed polytypes, or structures that are identical in two dimensions (the close-packed layers) but diﬀer in the third dimension.
- In one, the spheres are placed so that they reproduce the ﬁrst layer (Fig.
- Two polytypes are formed if the two stacking patterns are repeated in the vertical direction.

## 20.6 Ionic Solids

### Key ideas
- only 8, but there are six more atoms not much further away than the eight nearest neighbours.
- The packing fraction of 0.68 is not much smaller than the value for a Cl close-packed structure (0.74), and shows that about two-thirds of the available space is actually occupied.
- (a) Structure When crystals of compounds of monatomic ions (such as NaCl and MgO) are modelled by stacks of hard spheres it is essential to allow for the diﬀerent ionic radii (typically Fig.
- Even if, by chance, the ions have the same size, the problems of ensuring that the unit cells are electrically neutral makes it impossible to achieve 12-coordinate close- Cl Na packed ionic structures.
- As a result, ionic solids are generally less dense than metals.

## 20.8 Mechanical Properties

### Key ideas
- Each O atom is at the centre of a tetrahedron of four O atoms at a distance of 276 pm.
- The central O atom is attached by two short O-H bonds to two H atoms and by two long hydrogen bonds to the H atoms of two of the neighbouring molecules.
- The prediction of the structure is a very diﬃcult task, but software speciﬁcally designed to explore interaction energies can now make reasonably reliable predictions.
- The problem is made more complicated by the role of hydrogen bonds, which in some cases dominate the crystal structure, as in ice (Fig.
- 20.46), but in others (for example, in phenol) distort a structure that is determined largely by the van der Waals interactions.
