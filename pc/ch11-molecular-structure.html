    <h1>Chapter 11 Tutorial — Molecular structure</h1>
    <p>11 Molecular structure The Born–Oppenheimer The concepts developed in Chapter 10, particularly those of orbitals, can be extended to approximation a description of the electronic structures of molecules. There are two principal quantum mechanical theories of molecular electronic structure.</p>

        <li>is not possible for any molecule because the simplest molecule consists of three particles (two nuclei and one electron).</li>
        <li>We can therefore think of the nuclei as being ﬁxed at arbitrary locations, Energy and then solve the Schrödinger equation for the wavefunction of the electrons alone.</li>
        <li>0 The Born–Oppenheimer approximation allows us to select an internuclear separa- tion in a diatomic molecule and then to solve the Schrödinger equation for the elec- trons at that nuclear separation.</li>
        <li>11.1 A molecular potential energy meter is changed in a polyatomic molecule, we obtain a potential energy surface.</li>
        <li>The equilibrium bond length is called a potential energy curve because the kinetic energy of the stationary nuclei corresponds to the energy minimum.</li>

      <h2>11.2 Polyatomic Molecules</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>It is so called because, viewed along the inter- Nodal plane nuclear axis, a π bond resembles a pair of electrons in a p orbital (and π is the Greek equivalent of p).</li>
        <li>There are two π bonds in N2, one formed by spin pairing in two neighbouring 2px orbitals and the other by spin pairing in two neighbouring 2py orbitals.</li>
        <li>The overall bonding pattern in N2 is therefore a σ bond plus two π bonds (Fig.</li>
        <li>11.5), which is con- sistent with the Lewis structure :N.N: for nitrogen.</li>
        <li>11.2 Polyatomic molecules Internuclear axis Each σ bond in a polyatomic molecule is formed by the spin pairing of electrons in atomic orbitals with cylindrical symmetry about the relevant internuclear axis.</li>

      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A R B The one-electron wavefunctions obtained by solving the Schrödinger equation 1 Hψ = Eψ are called molecular orbitals (MO).</li>
        <li>A molecular orbital is like an atomic orbital, but spreads throughout the molecule.</li>
        <li>Therefore, we adopt a simpler procedure that, while more approximate, can be extended readily to other molecules.</li>
        <li>The technical term for the superposition in eqn 11.7 is a linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO).</li>

        <li>so, whereas 1σ becomes 1σg, its antibonding partner, which so far we have called 2σ, Comment 11.4 is the ﬁrst orbital of a different symmetry, and is denoted 1σu.</li>
        <li>The general rule is that When treating homonuclear diatomic each set of orbitals of the same symmetry designation is labelled separately.</li>
        <li>The general procedure is to construct molecular orbitals by combining the available atomic orbitals.</li>
        <li>We also take note of Hund’s maximum multiplicity rule (Section 10.4) that, if electrons do occupy different degenerate orbitals, then a lower energy is obtained if they do so with parallel spins.</li>

      <h2>11.8 The prediction of molecular properties</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The results of molecular orbital calculations are only approximate, with deviations from experimental values increasing with the size of the molecule.</li>
        <li>Therefore, one goal of computational chemistry is to gain insight into trends in properties of molecules, without necessarily striving for ultimate accuracy.</li>
        <li>The raw output of a molecular structure calculation is a list of the coeﬃcients of the atomic orbitals in each molecular orbital and the energies of these orbitals.</li>
        <li>Different signs of the wavefunctions are represented by different colours.</li>
        <li>Once the coeﬃcients are known, we can build up a representation of the electron density in the molecule by noting which orbitals are occupied and then forming the squares of those orbitals.</li>
