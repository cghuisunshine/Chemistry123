# Chapter 15 Tutorial — Molecular spectroscopy 3 magnetic resonance

## 15.4 The Nmr Spectrometer

### Key ideas
- 15.3) hν = γ $B 0 (15.13b)  hB 0 is fulﬁlled.
- Because γ $B 0 /h is the Larmor frequency of the nucleus, this resonance occurs when the frequency of the electromagnetic ﬁeld matches the Larmor frequency (ν = νL ).
- Larmor frequencies of nuclei at the ﬁelds normally employed (about 12 T) typically lie in the radiofrequency region of the electromagnetic spectrum (close to 500 MHz), so NMR is a radiofre- quency technique.
- As well as protons, which are the most common nuclei ﬁeld.
- Nuclear magnetic resonance Although the NMR technique is simple in concept, NMR spectra can be highly com- plex.

## 15.5 The chemical shift

### Key ideas
- The calculation of reliable values of the shielding constant is very diﬃcult, but trends in it are quite well understood and we concentrate on them.
- Other references are used for other nuclei.
- For 13C, the reference frequency is the 13C resonance in TMS; for 31P it is the 31P resonance in 85 per cent H3PO4(aq).
- The advantage of the δ -scale is that shifts reported on it are independent of the applied ﬁeld (because both numerator and denominator are pro- portional to the applied ﬁeld).
- A note on good practice In much of the literature, chemical shifts are reported in ‘parts per million’, ppm, in recognition of the factor of 106 in the deﬁnition.

## 15.6 The ﬁne structure

### Key ideas
- 15.6 is called the ﬁne structure of the spectrum.
- The strength of the interaction is expressed in terms of the scalar coupling constant, J, and reported in hertz (Hz).
- The scalar coupling constant is so called because the energy of interaction it describes is proportional to the scalar product of the two interacting Fig.
- The constant of proportionality in this expression is hJ/$2, because here) can give rise to local currents that each angular momentum is proportional to $.
- shield or deshield a proton in a solvent Spin coupling constants are independent of the strength of the applied ﬁeld because molecule.

## 15.8 The Magnetization Vector

### Key ideas
- The dependence of the rate of exchange on the temperature is used to determine the energy barrier to interconversion.
- For example, hydroxyl protons are able to exchange with water protons.
- The eﬀect is observed when the lifetime of a molecule due to this chemical exchange is so short that the lifetime broadening is greater than the doublet splitting.
- Because this splitting is often very small (a few hertz), a proton must remain attached to the same molecule for longer than about 0.1 s for the splitting to be observable.
- In water, the exchange rate is much faster than that, so alcohols show no splitting from the OH protons.

## 15.10 Spin Decoupling

### Key ideas
- Under these conditions, diﬀerences in signal intensities are directly related to diﬀerences in T1.
- A T2-weighted image is obtained by using an evolution period τ that is relatively long.
- Each point on the image is an echo signal that behaves in the manner shown in Fig.
- 15.40, so signal intensities are strongly dependent on variations in T2.
- The technique is particularly useful in enhancing image contrast and in diagnosing disease if the contrast agent is distributed diﬀerently in healthy and diseased tissues.

- A large molecule rotates so slowly that there is very little motion at 2ν, so we expect an intensity decrease (Fig.

## 15.12 Two-dimensional NMR

### Key ideas
- An NMR spectrum contains a great deal of information and, if many protons are pre- sent, is very complex.
- Even a ﬁrst-order spectrum is complex, for the ﬁne structure of diﬀerent groups of lines can overlap.
- This separation is essentially what is achieved in two-dimensional NMR.

## 15.13 Solid-state NMR

### Key ideas
- The principal diﬃculty with the application of NMR to solids is the low resolution characteristic of solid samples.
- Nevertheless, there are good reasons for seeking to overcome these diﬃculties.
- They include the possibility that a compound of interest is unstable in solution or that it is insoluble, so conventional solution NMR cannot be employed.
- Moreover, many species are intrinsically interesting as solids, and it is important to determine their structures and dynamics.
- Synthetic polymers are particu- larly interesting in this regard, and information can be obtained about the arrange- ment of molecules, their conformations, and the motion of diﬀerent parts of the chain.

- Typical dipole ﬁelds are of the order of 10−3 T, which corresponds to splittings and linewidths of the order of 104 Hz.
- A second source of linewidth is the anisotropy of the chemical shift.

- In solution, when the molecule is tumbling rapidly, only the average value of the chemical shift is relevant.

## 15.16 Hyperfine Structure

### Key ideas
- varying from 0 to 6, because in them ∆E is small (on account of the splitting of d- orbitals brought about by interactions with ligands, as we saw in Section 14.2).
- Just as in the case of the chemical shift in NMR spectroscopy, the g-value is anisotropic: that is, its magnitude depends on the orientation of the radical with respect to the applied ﬁeld.
- In solution, when the molecule is tumbling rapidly, only the average value of the g-value is observed.
