    <h1>Chapter 12 Tutorial — Molecular symmetry</h1>
    <p>12 Molecular symmetry The symmetry elements of In this chapter we sharpen the concept of ‘shape’ into a precise deﬁnition of ‘symmetry’, objects and show that symmetry may be discussed systematically. We see how to classify any molecule according to its symmetry and how to use this classiﬁcation to discuss molecular properties.</p>

      <h2>12.1 Operations And Symmetry Elements</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The twofold, threefold, and threefold (C3) axis and (b) an H2O fourfold axes are labelled with the molecule has a twofold (C2) axis.</li>
        <li>There are ﬁve kinds of symmetry operation (and ﬁve kinds of symmetry element) of this kind.</li>
        <li>These more extensive groups are called space groups.</li>
        <li>The identity, E, consists of doing nothing; the corresponding symmetry element is the entire object.</li>
        <li>Because every molecule is indistinguishable from itself if nothing is 1 CBrClFI done to it, every object possesses at least the identity element.</li>

      <h2>12.3 Some Immediate Consequences Of Symmetry</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Exploring the consequences of R3 is a very important way of applying symmetry arguments to atoms, and is an alternative Ru approach to the theory of orbital angular momentum.</li>
        <li>12.7 is shown by a green cp (= C5H5) line; it ends at Dnh.</li>
        <li>If the rings were staggered, as they are in an excited state of ferrocene that lies 4 kJ mol−1 above the ground state (17), the horizontal reﬂection plane would be Fe absent, but dihedral planes would be present.</li>
        <li>(a) Polarity A polar molecule is one with a permanent electric dipole moment (HCl, O3, and NH3 are examples).</li>
        <li>In all the other groups, such as C3h, D, etc., there are symmetry operations that take one end of the molecule into the other.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>12.4 Character Tables And Symmetry Labels</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>In the language introduced in this molecules are labelled σ, π, etc.</li>
        <li>Thus, a are +1 and −1 for the σ and π orbitals, respectively.</li>
        <li>For example, we can speak of an individual pz orbital as having σ symmetry if the z-axis lies along the bond, because pz is cylindrically symmetrical about the bond.</li>
        <li>(a) Representations and characters Labels analogous to σ and π are used to denote the symmetries of orbitals in poly- atomic molecules.</li>
        <li>A label is assigned to an orbital by referring to the character table of the group, a C2 (i.e.</li>

      <h2>12.5 Vanishing integrals and orbital overlap y</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Suppose we had to evaluate the integral  I = f1 f2 dτ (12.7) x where f1 and f2 are functions.</li>
        <li>If we knew that the integral is zero, we could say at once that a molecular (a) orbital does not result from (A,B) overlap in that molecule.</li>
        <li>We shall now see that character tables provide a quick way of judging whether an integral is necessarily zero.</li>
        <li>In group theory we express this point by saying that I is invariant under any symmetry operation of the molecule, and that each operation brings about the trivial transformation I → I.</li>
        <li>It follows that the example, an area) is independent of the only contribution to a nonzero integral comes from functions for which under any coordinate system used to evaluate it.</li>

      <h2>12.6 Vanishing Integrals And Selection Rules</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Applying the same technique to the column under sA gives ψ = –16 (sA + s B + sC + sA + s B + sC ) = –31 (sA + s B + sC) The same combination is built from the other two columns, so they give no further information.</li>
        <li>The combination we have just formed is the s1 combination we used before (apart from the numerical factor).</li>
        <li>In this case, therefore, the a1 molecular orbital is ψ = cNs N + c1s1 This is as far as group theory can take us.</li>
        <li>The coeﬃcients are found by solving the Schrödinger equation; they do not come directly from the symmetry of the system.</li>
        <li>The diﬀerence of the second and third gives –12 (sB − sC), and this combination and the ﬁrst, –16 (2sA − s B − sC) are the two (now linearly independent) SALCs we have used in the discussion of e orbitals.</li>
      </ul>
