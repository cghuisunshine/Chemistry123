# Chapter 3 Tutorial — The Second Law

3 The Second Law The direction of spontaneous The purpose of this chapter is to explain the origin of the spontaneity of physical and chem- change ical change. We examine two simple processes and show how to deﬁne, measure, and use a property, the entropy, to discuss spontaneous changes quantitatively.

## 3.1 The Dispersal Of Energy

### Key ideas
- statement is a generalization of another everyday observation, that a ball at rest on a surface has never been observed to leap spontaneously upwards.
- It is not the total energy of the isolated system.
- Is it perhaps the energy of the system that tends towards a minimum?
- First, a perfect gas expands spontaneously into a Law denies the possibility of the process vacuum, yet its internal energy remains constant as it does so.
- Secondly, if the energy illustrated here, in which heat is changed of a system does happen to decrease during a spontaneous change, the energy of its completely into work, there being no other change.

## 3.2 Entropy

### Key ideas
- A simpliﬁcation is that the expan- sion is isothermal, so the temperature is a constant and may be taken outside the integral in eqn 3.2.
- Molar entropy, the entropy divided by the amount of substance, is expressed in joules per kelvin per mole (J K−1 mol−1).2 The molar entropy is an intensive property.
- Self-test 3.1 Calculate the change in entropy when the pressure of a perfect gas is changed isothermally from pi to pf .
- 80 3 THE SECOND LAW internal energy, dUsur.3 The internal energy is a state function, and dUsur is an exact diﬀerential.
- As we have seen, these properties imply that dUsur is independent of how the change is brought about and in particular is independent of whether the process is reversible or irreversible.

- The logarithmic dependence of entropy on 0.001 m3 to 0.010 m3 at 298 K, treated volume is illustrated in Fig.
- Consequently, ∆Ssur = 0, and the total entropy change is given by eqn 3.13 itself: Vf ∆Stot = nR ln (3.15)° Vi In this case, ∆Stot > 0, as we expect for an irreversible process.

## 3.4 The Third Law of thermodynamics

### Key ideas
- At T = 0, all energy of thermal motion has been quenched, and in a perfect crystal all the atoms or ions are in a regular, uniform array.
- This conclusion is consistent with the molecular interpretation of entropy, because S = 0 if there is only one way of arranging the molecules and only one microstate is accessible (the ground state).
- It is found that Sm(α) = Sm(α,0) + 37 J K−1 mol−1 3.4 THE THIRD LAW OF THEMODYNAMICS 93 and Sm(β) = Sm(β,0) + 38 J K−1 mol−1.
- This conclusion is summarized by the Third Law of thermodynamics: The entropy of all perfect crystalline substances is zero at T = 0.
- As far as thermodynamics is concerned, choosing this common value as zero is then a matter of convenience.

- Equation 3.26 expresses the criteria for spontaneous change in terms of properties relating to the system.
- That statement is essentially the content of the Second Law.
- The second inequality is less obvious, for it says that, if the entropy and volume of the sys- tem are constant, then the internal energy must decrease in a spontaneous change.

## 3.8 Properties Of The Internal Energy

### Key ideas
- any additional (non-expansion) work, we may set dwrev = −pdV and (from the deﬁni- tion of entropy) dqrev = TdS, where p is the pressure of the system and T its tempera- ture.
- Therefore, for a reversible change in a closed system, dU = TdS − pdV (3.43) However, because dU is an exact diﬀerential, its value is independent of path.
- There- fore, the same value of dU is obtained whether the change is brought about irreversibly or reversibly.
- We shall call this com- bination of the First and Second Laws the fundamental equation.
- The fact that the fundamental equation applies to both reversible and irreversible changes may be puzzling at ﬁrst sight.

- They lead to expressions showing how G varies with pressure and temperature that are important for discussing phase transitions and chemical reactions.
- It conﬁrms that G is an important quantity in chemistry because the pressure and temperature are usu- ally the variables under our control.
