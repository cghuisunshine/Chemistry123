      <h2>13.1 Experimental Techniques</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>In absorption radiation spectroscopy, the net absorption of nearly monochromatic (single frequency) incid- ent radiation is monitored as the radiation is swept over a range of frequencies.</li>
        <li>We say net absorption, because it will become clear that, when a sample is irradiated, both absorption and emission at a given frequency are stimulated, and the detector meas- ures the diﬀerence, the net absorption.</li>
        <li>We shall discuss emission spectroscopy in a lower frequency if it loses energy to the Chapter 14; here we focus on absorption spectroscopy, which is widely employed in molecule.</li>
        <li>taking place by an excitation of the In Chapter 9 we saw that transitions between electronic energy levels are stimulated molecule to a wide range of states by or emit ultraviolet, visible, or near-infrared radiation.</li>
        <li>subsequent return of the molecule to a First, the direct absorption or emission of infrared radiation can cause changes in lower state; the net energy change is then carried away by the photon.</li>

      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Monochromator or interferometer The ratio of the transmitted intensity, I, to the incident intensity, I0, at a given frequency is called the transmittance, T, of the sample at that frequency: Fig.</li>
        <li>The Beer–Lambert law: spectrum is analysed by a monochromator or an interferometer.</li>
        <li>I = I010−ε[J]l (13.2) The quantity ε is called the molar absorption coeﬃcient (formerly, and still widely, the ‘extinction coeﬃcient’).</li>
        <li>The molar absorption coeﬃcient depends on the frequency of the incident radiation and is greatest where the absorption is most intense.</li>
        <li>Its dimensions are 1/(concentration × length), and it is normally convenient to express it in cubic decimetres per mole per centimetre (dm3 mol−1 cm−1).</li>

      <h3>Key ideas</h3>

        <li>In most cases, absorption by an inter- stellar species is detected against the background of infrared radiation emitted by a nearby star.</li>

        <li>m (a) Rotational selection rules We have already remarked (Section 13.2) that the gross selection rule for the observa- tion of a pure rotational spectrum is that a molecule must have a permanent electric dipole moment.</li>
        <li>That is, for a molecule to give a pure rotational spectrum, it must be m polar.</li>
        <li>The classical basis of this rule is that a polar molecule appears to possess a ﬂuctuating dipole when rotating, but a nonpolar molecule does not (Fig.13.17).</li>

      <h2>13.7 Rotational Raman Spectra</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Speciﬁcally, the population of a rotational energy level J is given by the Boltzmann expression NJ ∝ NgJ e−EJ /kT where N is the total number of molecules and gJ is the degeneracy of the level J.</li>
        <li>The value of J corresponding to a maximum of this expression is found by treating J as a continuous variable, diﬀerentiating with respect to J, and then setting the result equal to zero.</li>
        <li>The result is (see Problem 13.24) 1/2 A kT D Jmax ≈ − –12 (13.39) C 2hcB F For a typical molecule (for example, OCS, with B = 0.2 cm−1) at room temperature, kT ≈ 1000hcB, so Jmax ≈ 30.</li>
        <li>However, it must be recalled that the intensity of each transition also depends on the value of J (eqn 13.36) and on the population diﬀerence between the two states involved in the transition (see Section 13.2).</li>
        <li>Hence the value of J corresponding to the most intense line is not quite the same as the value of J for the most highly populated level.</li>

      <h3>Key ideas</h3>

        <li>The form of the Pauli principle J=2 given in Justiﬁcation Section 10.4 states that, when two identical bosons are exchanged, the overall wavefunction must remain unchanged in every respect, including sign.</li>
        <li>In particular, when a CO2 molecule rotates through 180°, two identical O nuclei are interchanged, so the overall wavefunction of the molecule must remain unchanged.</li>
        <li>Therefore, only even values of J are permissible for CO2, and hence the Raman spectrum shows only alternate lines.</li>

      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The normal modes of vibration of molecules are Raman active if they are accom- panied by a changing polarizability.</li>
        <li>It is sometimes quite diﬃcult to judge by inspec- tion when this is so.</li>
        <li>The symmetric stretch of CO2, for example, alternately swells and contracts the molecule: this motion changes the polarizability of the molecule, so the mode is Raman active.</li>
        <li>The other modes of CO2 leave the polarizability unchanged, so they are Raman inactive.</li>
        <li>(A mode may be inactive in both.) Because it is often possible to judge intuitively if a I mode changes the molecular dipole moment, we can use this rule to identify modes that are not Raman active.</li>
