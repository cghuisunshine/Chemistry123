## 22.1 Experimental techniques

### Key ideas
- The solutions of these 22.3 Integrated rate laws equations are used to predict the concentrations of species at any time after the start of the reaction.
- The form of the rate law also provides insight into the series of elementary steps 22.4 Reactions approaching by which a reaction takes place.
- The key task in this connection is the construction of a rate equilibrium law from a proposed mechanism and its comparison with experiment.
- The basic data of chemical kinetics are Problems then the concentrations of the reactants and products at diﬀerent times after a reac- tion has been initiated.
- The rates of most chemical reactions are sensitive to the tem- perature, so in conventional experiments the temperature of the reaction mixture must be held constant throughout the course of the reaction.

## 22.2 The rates of reactions

### Key ideas
- (a) The deﬁnition of rate Consider a reaction of the form A + 2 B → 3 C + D, in which at some instant the molar concentration of a participant J is [J] and the volume of the system is constant.
- The (a) instantaneous rate of consumption of one of the reactants at a given time is −d[R]/dt, Tangent, where R is A or B.
- This rate is a positive quantity (Fig.
- The rate of formation of rate  slope one of the products (C or D, which we denote P) is d[P]/dt (note the diﬀerence in sign).
- Molar concentration, [J] Product It follows from the stoichiometry for the reaction A + 2 B → 3 C + D that d[D] d[C] d[A] d[B] = –13 =− = − –12 dt dt dt dt so there are several rates connected with the reaction.

## 22.3 Integrated rate laws

### Key ideas
- Because rate laws are diﬀerential equations, we must integrate them if we want to ﬁnd the concentrations as a function of time.
- However, in a number of simple cases analytical solutions, known as integrated rate laws, are easily obtained, and prove to be very useful.

## 22.4 Reactions approaching equilibrium

### Key ideas
- Because all the laws considered so far disregard the possibility that the reverse reaction is important, none of them describes the overall rate when the reaction is close to equilibrium.
- In practice, however, most kinetic studies are made on reactions that are far from equilibrium, and the reverse reactions are unimportant.
- The scheme we consider is A→B v = k[A] (22.20) B→A v = k′[B] The concentration of A is reduced by the forward reaction (at a rate k[A]) but it is increased by the reverse reaction (at a rate k′[B]).
- The net rate of change is therefore d[A] = −k[A] + k′[B] (22.21) dt If the initial concentration of A is [A]0, and no B is present initially, then at all times [A] + [B] = [A]0.

- Non-Arrhenius behaviour is sometimes a sign that quantum mechanical tunnelling is playing a signiﬁcant role in the reaction (Section 22.7f).
- The climax of the reaction is at the peak of the potential energy, which corresponds to the activation energy Ea.
- This crucial conﬁguration is called the transition state of The terms actiVated complex and the reaction.
- We also conclude from the preceding discussion that, for a reaction involving the collision of two molecules, the activation energy is the minimum kinetic energy that re- actants must have in order to form products.

## 22.8 Unimolecular reactions

### Key ideas
- However, collisions are simple bimolecular events, so how can they result in a ﬁrst-order rate law?
- First-order gas-phase reactions are widely called ‘unimole- cular reactions’ because they also involve an elementary unimolecular step in which the reactant molecule changes into the product.
- In the Lindemann– Hinshelwood mechanism it is supposed that a reactant molecule A becomes ener- Fig.
- The Lindemann–Hinshelwood mechanism can be tested because it predicts that, as the concentration (and therefore the partial pressure) of A is reduced, the reaction should switch to overall second-order kinetics.
- Thus, when k′a[A] << kb, the rate law in eqn 22.63 is d[P] ≈ ka[A]2 (22.65) dt The physical reason for the change of order is that at low pressures the rate-determining step is the bimolecular formation of A*.
