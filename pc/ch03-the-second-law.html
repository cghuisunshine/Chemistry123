    <h1>Chapter 3 Tutorial — The Second Law</h1>
    <p>3 The Second Law The direction of spontaneous The purpose of this chapter is to explain the origin of the spontaneity of physical and chem- change ical change. We examine two simple processes and show how to deﬁne, measure, and use a property, the entropy, to discuss spontaneous changes quantitatively.</p>

      <h2>3.1 The Dispersal Of Energy</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>statement is a generalization of another everyday observation, that a ball at rest on a surface has never been observed to leap spontaneously upwards.</li>
        <li>It is not the total energy of the isolated system.</li>
        <li>Is it perhaps the energy of the system that tends towards a minimum?</li>
        <li>First, a perfect gas expands spontaneously into a Law denies the possibility of the process vacuum, yet its internal energy remains constant as it does so.</li>
        <li>Secondly, if the energy illustrated here, in which heat is changed of a system does happen to decrease during a spontaneous change, the energy of its completely into work, there being no other change.</li>

      <h2>3.2 Entropy</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A simpliﬁcation is that the expan- sion is isothermal, so the temperature is a constant and may be taken outside the integral in eqn 3.2.</li>
        <li>Molar entropy, the entropy divided by the amount of substance, is expressed in joules per kelvin per mole (J K−1 mol−1).2 The molar entropy is an intensive property.</li>

        <li>80 3 THE SECOND LAW internal energy, dUsur.3 The internal energy is a state function, and dUsur is an exact diﬀerential.</li>
        <li>As we have seen, these properties imply that dUsur is independent of how the change is brought about and in particular is independent of whether the process is reversible or irreversible.</li>

        <li>The logarithmic dependence of entropy on 0.001 m3 to 0.010 m3 at 298 K, treated volume is illustrated in Fig.</li>
        <li>Consequently, ∆Ssur = 0, and the total entropy change is given by eqn 3.13 itself: Vf ∆Stot = nR ln (3.15)° Vi In this case, ∆Stot > 0, as we expect for an irreversible process.</li>

        <li>At T = 0, all energy of thermal motion has been quenched, and in a perfect crystal all the atoms or ions are in a regular, uniform array.</li>
        <li>This conclusion is consistent with the molecular interpretation of entropy, because S = 0 if there is only one way of arranging the molecules and only one microstate is accessible (the ground state).</li>

        <li>That statement is essentially the content of the Second Law.</li>
        <li>The second inequality is less obvious, for it says that, if the entropy and volume of the sys- tem are constant, then the internal energy must decrease in a spontaneous change.</li>

        <li>Therefore, for a reversible change in a closed system, dU = TdS − pdV (3.43) However, because dU is an exact diﬀerential, its value is independent of path.</li>
