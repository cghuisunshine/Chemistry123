# Chapter 6 Tutorial — Phase diagrams

6 Phase diagrams Phases, components, and Phase diagrams for pure substances were introduced in Chapter 4. Now we develop their degrees of freedom use systematically and show how they are rich summaries of empirical information about a wide range of systems.

## 6.1 Definitions

### Key ideas
- A solution of sodium chloride in water is a single phase.
- Ice is a single phase (P = 1) even though it might be chipped into small fragments.
- A slurry of ice and water is a two-phase system (P = 2) even though it is diﬃcult to map the boundaries between the phases.
- An alloy of two metals is a two-phase system (P = 2) if the metals are immiscible, but a single-phase system (P = 1) if they are miscible.
- This example shows that it is not (a) (b) always easy to decide whether a system consists of one phase or of two.
