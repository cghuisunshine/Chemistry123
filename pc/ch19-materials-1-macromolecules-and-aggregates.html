    <h1>Chapter 19 Tutorial — Materials 1 macromolecules and aggregates</h1>
    <p>19 Materials 1: macromolecules and aggregates Determination of size and shape Macromolecules exhibit a range of properties and problems that illustrate a wide variety of physical chemical principles. They need to be characterized in terms of their molar mass, their size, and their shape.</p>

      <h2>19.1 Mean Molar Masses</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>place, the sample might be a mixture of molecules with diﬀerent chain lengths and extents of cross-linking, in which case sharp X-ray images are not obtained.</li>
        <li>Furthermore, although work on proteins and DNA has shown how im- mensely interesting and motivating the data can be, the information is incomplete.</li>
        <li>A synthetic polymer, however, is polydisperse, in the sense that a sample is a mixture of molecules with various chain lengths and molar masses.</li>
        <li>The various techniques that are used to measure molar masses result in diﬀerent types of mean values of polydisperse systems.</li>
        <li>Because mi = Ni Mi /NA, we can also express this average as ∑ Ni Mi2 i Jw = (19.3) ∑ Ni Mi i This expression shows that the weight-average molar mass is proportional to the mean square molar mass.</li>

      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>same because the sample is monodisperse (unless there has been degradation).</li>
        <li>The term ‘mono- disperse’ is conventionally applied to synthetic polymers in which this index is less than 1.1; commercial polyethylene samples might be much more heterogeneous, with a ratio close to 30.</li>
        <li>One consequence of a narrow molar mass distribution for synthetic polymers is often a higher degree of three-dimensional long-range order in the solid and therefore higher density and melting point.</li>
        <li>The spread of values is controlled by the choice of catalyst and reaction conditions.</li>
        <li>In practice, it is found that long- range order is determined more by structural factors (branching, for instance) than by molar mass.</li>

      <h2>19.3 Laser light scattering</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A familiar example is the light scattered by specks of dust in a sunbeam.</li>
        <li>Therefore, light scattering is a convenient method for the characterization of polymers, large aggregates (such as colloids), and biological systems from proteins to viruses.</li>
        <li>Unlike mass spectrometry, laser light scattering measurements may be performed in nearly intact samples; often the only preparation required is ﬁltration of the sample.</li>
        <li>Elastic light scattering is observed as the oscillating dipoles in the particle radiate at the same frequency as the frequency of the exciting electromagnetic radiation.</li>
        <li>If the medium is perfectly homogeneous, as in a perfect crystal, the scattered waves interfere destructively in all directions except the direction of propagation of the exciting radiation.</li>

      <h2>19.4 Ultracentrifugation</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The rate of sedimentation depends on the strength of the ﬁeld and on the masses and shapes of the particles.</li>
        <li>When the sample is at equilibrium, the particles are dispersed over a range of heights in accord with the Boltzmann distribution (because the gravitational ﬁeld competes with the stirring eﬀect of thermal motion).</li>
        <li>The spread of heights depends on the masses of the molecules, so the equilibrium distribution is another way to determine molar mass.</li>
        <li>Sedimentation is normally very slow, but it can be accelerated by ultracentri- fugation, a technique that replaces the gravitational ﬁeld with a centrifugal ﬁeld.</li>
        <li>The eﬀect can be achieved in an ultracentrifuge, which is essentially a cylinder that can be rotated at high speed about its axis with a sample in a cell near its periphery (Fig.</li>

      <h2>19.5 Electrophoresis</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The centrifuge is run more slowly in this technique than in the sedimentation rate method to avoid having all the solute pressed in a thin ﬁlm against the bottom of the cell.</li>
        <li>The condition for equilibrium is therefore A ∂ ln c D Mrω 2(1 − vρ) − RT B E =0 C ∂r F T,p and therefore, at constant temperature, Mrω 2(1 − vρ)dr d ln c = RT This expression integrates to eqn 19.20.</li>
        <li>19.5 Electrophoresis Many macromolecules, such as DNA, are charged and move in response to an electric ﬁeld.</li>
        <li>This motion is called electrophoresis.</li>
        <li>Electrophoretic mobility is a result of a constant drift speed, s, reached by an ion when the driving force zeE (where, as usual, ze is the net charge and E is the ﬁeld strength) is matched by the frictional force fs.</li>

        <li>One way to avoid this problem and to achieve separation by molar mass is to denature the 0.5 proteins in a controlled way.</li>
        <li>Sodium dodecyl sulfate is an anionic detergent that is Speed, s /6 m s1) very useful in this respect: it denatures proteins, whatever their initial shapes, into 0 rods by forming a complex with them.</li>
        <li>Moreover, most protein molecules bind a con- stant number of ions, so the net charge per protein is well regulated.</li>
        <li>The 0.5 molar mass of each constituent protein is estimated by comparing its mobility in its rod-like complex form with that of a standard sample of known molar mass.</li>

      <h2>19.8 Random coils</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The most likely conformation of a chain of identical units not capable of forming hydrogen bonds or any other type of speciﬁc bond is a random coil.</li>
        <li>The random coil model is a helpful starting point for estimating the orders of magnitude of the hydrodynamic properties of polymers and denatured pro- teins in solution.</li>
        <li>The simplest model of a random coil is a freely jointed chain, in which any bond is free to make any angle with respect to the preceding one (Fig.</li>
        <li>The model is obviously an oversimpliﬁcation because a bond is actually constrained to a cone of angles around a direction deﬁned by its neighbour (Fig.</li>
        <li>In a hypothetical one-dimensional freely jointed chain all the residues lie in a straight line, and the angle between neighbours is either 0° or 180°.</li>

        <li>A sol is a dis- persion of a solid in a liquid (such as clusters of gold atoms in water) or of a solid in a solid (such as ruby glass, which is a gold-in-glass sol, and achieves its colour by light scattering).</li>
