    <h1>Chapter 11 Tutorial — Liquids and Intermolecular Forces</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>11.1 A Molecular Comparison of Gases, Liquids, and Solids</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The three states differ because of the balance between kinetic energy (temperature-driven motion) and intermolecular attractions.</li>
        <li>Gases have widely spaced particles and negligible attractions, liquids have closer particles that remain mobile, and solids have tightly bound particles fixed in place.</li>
        <li>Heating boosts kinetic energy to overcome intermolecular forces, while increasing pressure brings particles closer so attractions dominate.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Average kinetic energy:</strong> <code>KE_avg ∝ T</code>. Higher temperature increases molecular motion so particles resist attraction, which explains why solids melt and gases expand when heated.</li>
        <li><strong>Density trend:</strong> <code>ρ_gas ≪ ρ_liquid ≈ ρ_solid</code>. Denser phases reflect stronger intermolecular forces because particles pack more tightly.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>The halogens illustrate the concept: I₂ is a solid, Br₂ a liquid, and Cl₂ a gas at room temperature because dispersion forces weaken going up the group, so kinetic energy overcomes attraction more readily.</p>

      <h2>11.2 Intermolecular Forces</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Intermolecular forces include dispersion (instantaneous dipoles), dipole–dipole, hydrogen bonding, and ion–dipole interactions, all electrostatic in nature.</li>
        <li>Dispersion forces depend on polarizability: larger, more polarizable electron clouds (heavy atoms, extended molecules) produce stronger induced dipoles and larger boiling points.</li>
        <li>Polar molecules add permanent dipole attractions, and hydrogen-bonding partners (N, O, F) create especially strong, directional forces.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dispersion energy scale:</strong> <code>E_disp ∝ α₁α₂/r⁶</code>, where α is polarizability and r is distance. Big, squishy electron clouds yield large α values and stronger dispersion (Figure 11.5).</li>
        <li><strong>Dipole–dipole strength:</strong> <code>E_dd ∝ μ²/r³</code>; molecules with larger permanent dipoles (e.g., CH₃CN) have stronger attractions than nonpolar analogs (propane).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Acetonitrile (bp 355 K) vs propane (bp 231 K) demonstrates dipole–dipole effects—similar molar masses but different polarities cause a higher boiling point for the polar molecule.</p>
      <p>HF boils at 293 K because of hydrogen bonding, while HCl boils at 188 K even though both are similar in size; hydrogen bonding adds a strong additional IMF.</p>

      <h2>11.3 Select Properties of Liquids</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Viscosity is a liquid’s resistance to flow and increases with stronger intermolecular forces or more entangled, larger molecules; temperature reduces viscosity by providing kinetic energy to break those interactions.</li>
        <li>Surface tension measures the energy cost of creating new surface area; surface molecules experience a net inward pull, so liquids like water bead up and support light insects.</li>
        <li>Capillary action occurs when adhesive forces to a surface outweigh liquid cohesion, allowing liquids to climb narrow tubes or fabrics to wick away moisture.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Surface tension:</strong> <code>γ = E/A</code>. It equals the energy needed to increase surface area by 1 m², so higher γ (e.g., mercury 0.146 J/m²) reflects stronger cohesion.</li>
        <li><strong>Viscosity trend:</strong> <code>η ∝ exp(Eₐ/RT)</code>. The activation energy Eₐ represents the IMFs that molecules must overcome to flow, so raising temperature drops η exponentially (octane’s viscosity halves between 0 and 40 °C).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Hexane through decane show increasing viscosity because longer carbon chains experience stronger dispersion and entanglement (Table 11.3).</p>
      <p>Capillary rise in a glass tube occurs because water–glass adhesive forces exceed water–water cohesion, giving a concave meniscus, whereas mercury forms a convex meniscus because cohesion dominates.</p>

      <h2>11.4 Phase Changes</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Phase changes between solid, liquid, and gas absorb or release energy: fusion, vaporization, sublimation, and their reverse processes.</li>
        <li>Heating curves display horizontal plateaus at constant temperature while a phase change occurs, because added energy breaks intermolecular forces rather than raises temperature.</li>
        <li>Above the critical temperature, a distinct liquid cannot form because kinetic energy overwhelms attractions even under high pressure, leading to supercritical fluids.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Enthalpy partition:</strong> <code>∆H_sub = ∆H_fus + ∆H_vap</code>. Sublimation requires both melting and vaporization energies, so ∆H_sub for water is ~47 kJ/mol from its fusion (6 kJ/mol) and vaporization (40 kJ/mol).</li>
        <li><strong>Heat of vaporization:</strong> ∆H_vap measures the energy needed to separate liquid molecules into vapor; for water it is 40.7 kJ/mol, explaining why evaporation cools skin and why refrigerators reject heat during condensation.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Water’s heating curve shows plateaus at 0 °C and 100 °C where melting and boiling occur; once all the ice melts or water vaporizes, the temperature rises again (Figure 11.22).</p>
      <p>At 374 °C (critical temperature) and 22.06 MPa (critical pressure), water cannot condense into a distinct liquid; raising pressure above this point produces a compressible supercritical fluid.</p>

      <h2>11.5 Vapor Pressure</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Vapor pressure</strong> is the pressure of a vapor in dynamic equilibrium with its liquid (or solid) at a given temperature.</li>
        <li>At higher temperature, more molecules have enough kinetic energy to escape the liquid, so vapor pressure increases.</li>
        <li>Stronger intermolecular forces hold molecules in the liquid more tightly, so they reduce vapor pressure and raise boiling point.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Boiling condition:</strong> A liquid boils when <code>P_vap = P_ext</code>. The <em>normal</em> boiling point is when <code>P_ext = 1 atm</code> (or 1 bar by some conventions).</li>
        <li><strong>Clausius–Clapeyron (two-temperature form):</strong> <code>ln(P2/P1) = −(ΔH_vap/R)(1/T2 − 1/T1)</code>. It relates how vapor pressure changes with temperature using <code>ΔH_vap</code> (J/mol), <code>R</code> (8.314 J·mol⁻¹·K⁻¹), and absolute temperature <code>T</code> (K).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Because ethanol has a lower normal boiling point than water, it has a higher vapor pressure at room temperature. That is why ethanol evaporates more readily and produces a stronger “cooling” sensation on skin.</p>

      <h2>11.6 Phase Diagrams</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A phase diagram maps which phase (solid/liquid/gas) is stable at different temperatures and pressures.</li>
        <li>The <strong>triple point</strong> is where solid, liquid, and gas coexist; the <strong>critical point</strong> marks the end of the liquid–gas boundary.</li>
        <li>Water is unusual: its solid–liquid boundary slopes “backward” because ice is less dense than liquid water, so increasing pressure favors liquid.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Phase-boundary slope (Clapeyron equation):</strong> <code>dP/dT = ΔH/(TΔV)</code>. It explains why the solid–liquid line slopes depend on volume change <code>ΔV</code> between phases.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>Above the critical temperature, increasing pressure cannot liquefy the gas; instead you get a supercritical fluid with properties of both phases (high density like a liquid, high diffusivity like a gas).</p>

      <h2>11.7 Liquid Crystals</h2>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Liquid crystals are phases that flow like liquids but maintain some orientational order like solids.</li>
        <li>Nematic phases have aligned molecular axes but no layered structure; smectic phases have both alignment and layering.</li>
        <li>Electric fields can reorient liquid-crystal molecules, changing how they transmit polarized light—this is the basis of LCD screens.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Important formulas &amp; their meaning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Birefringence (qualitative):</strong> Many liquid crystals have different refractive indices along different directions (often summarized as <code>Δn = n_e − n_o</code>), which is why their optical properties change when molecules reorient.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Short example(s)</h3>
      <p>In an LCD pixel, applying voltage changes molecular alignment, which changes light polarization through the layer. The polarizers then block or pass light, producing dark or bright pixels.</p>
